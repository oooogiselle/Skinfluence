       "      <td>Product name: Glossier Futuredew\\n\\nPrice: $30 CAD/$24 USD for 30 mL\\n\\nWarning: long review ahead!\\n\\nWhen I was deciding whether to buy this, I didn’t find many reviews, so now that I’ve been using it for a while, I thought I’d post a review in case anyone else was interested. I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks. \\n\\nGlossier describes this product as an “oil serum hybrid” - it contains Jojoba, Grape Seed, Evening Primrose, and Rosehip Oils, as well as Squalane and Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract (fruit extract known to visibly increase brightness). It also contains mica to help give it that glowy, reflective finish. \\n\\nGlossier suggests applying this as the last step in your skincare routine (after sunscreen), which initially had me a bit confused, since usually sunscreen would be the last step in my skincare routine. But what I’ve now realized is that this product is not just skincare - it’s more like a skincare/makeup combo (and in my opinion, leans more towards makeup than skincare - more on that later). \\n\\nThis product dispenses as a peach-coloured serum with a slight pearly sheen. When applied to my face, it’s not oily or greasy like some face oils, but it definitely has a slight wet/sticky feeling on the face, which does fade slightly after a few minutes as the product absorbs. \\n\\nAs for the look - it does do an amazing job of giving me a glowy, dewy, “just-did-a-sheet-mask” look. The recommended two pumps is a bit too shiny for me, so I use one pump and I’m good. I have normal/dry skin. I did feel like it made some of my hyperpigmentation and scars look more prominent, but I was able to counteract that with a bit of concealer, which actually applied quite nicely over top of the Futuredew. Although it contains mica, I really don’t notice a shimmery/glittery appearance at all, it really just looks like a natural glow. \\n\\nIn terms of the skincare benefits, it has a slight moisturizing effect, but nothing major that I’m not already getting from my routine. I don’t think I’ve seen any significant change to my skin over the 6 weeks I’ve been using it, other than the short-term glow. So I think the product description of “oil serum hybrid” is a bit misleading. I would describe it more as an “face oil-highlighter hybrid”. \\n\\nSo overall, does it deliver? As an “oil-serum hybrid”, not quite. But as a “shortcut to the way your skin looks after a full skincare routine—dewy, glowing, cared-for” (another description from the Glossier website) - yes, it delivers. I think this is more of an issue with inconsistency in the way Glossier marketed this product than in the product itself. I think the product is good at what it does, which is giving that dewy look and making it last throughout the day. But don’t expect any significant lasting benefits. \\n\\nSo will I continue to use this product? I will use up the bottle I have, but probably not repurchase. I just don’t see this product as a necessary part of my routine. If I want glowy skin, I’m more likely to reach for a classic highlighter like Glossier’s haloscope, and if I want a moisturizing oil, I’m more likely to reach for TO’s Rosehip oil. I’m just not reaching for Futuredew as much as I’d like to. \\n\\nOverall rating: 3.5/5 WNRP</td>\n",

Especially with Korean skincare, you have hyaluronic acid nearly everytime included in the product, plus you can also choose a product that has other hydrating ingredients. As well as healing, soothing or strengthening the skin barrier. \\nI like Korean skincare because it usually offers a multiple targeting of skin issues. This hyaluronic acid serum reminds me a western skincare. \\nI would rather pick something like iUNIK Beta glucan serum. Which has also calming benefits, is an antioxidant, repair skin barrier function and apparently it's ability to retain moisture is 20% better than hyaluronic acid.

       "381   Product name: Glossier Futuredew\\n\\nPrice: $30 CAD/$24 USD for 30 mL\\n\\nWarning: long review ahead!\\n\\nWhen I was deciding whether to buy this, I didn’t find many reviews, so now that I’ve been using it for a while, I thought I’d post a review in case anyone else was interested. I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks. \\n\\nGlossier describes this product as an “oil serum hybrid” - it contains Jojoba, Grape Seed, Evening Primrose, and Rosehip Oils, as well as Squalane and Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract (fruit extract known to visibly increase brightness). It also contains mica to help give it that glowy, reflective finish. \\n\\nGlossier suggests applying this as the last step in your skincare routine (after sunscreen), which initially had me a bit confused, since usually sunscreen would be the last step in my skincare routine. But what I’ve now realized is that this product is not just skincare - it’s more like a skincare/makeup combo (and in my opinion, leans more towards makeup than skincare - more on that later). \\n\\nThis product dispenses as a peach-coloured serum with a slight pearly sheen. When applied to my face, it’s not oily or greasy like some face oils, but it definitely has a slight wet/sticky feeling on the face, which does fade slightly after a few minutes as the product absorbs. \\n\\nAs for the look - it does do an amazing job of giving me a glowy, dewy, “just-did-a-sheet-mask” look. The recommended two pumps is a bit too shiny for me, so I use one pump and I’m good. I have normal/dry skin. I did feel like it made some of my hyperpigmentation and scars look more prominent, but I was able to counteract that with a bit of concealer, which actually applied quite nicely over top of the Futuredew. Although it contains mica, I really don’t notice a shimmery/glittery appearance at all, it really just looks like a natural glow. \\n\\nIn terms of the skincare benefits, it has a slight moisturizing effect, but nothing major that I’m not already getting from my routine. I don’t think I’ve seen any significant change to my skin over the 6 weeks I’ve been using it, other than the short-term glow. So I think the product description of “oil serum hybrid” is a bit misleading. I would describe it more as an “face oil-highlighter hybrid”. \\n\\nSo overall, does it deliver? As an “oil-serum hybrid”, not quite. But as a “shortcut to the way your skin looks after a full skincare routine—dewy, glowing, cared-for” (another description from the Glossier website) - yes, it delivers. I think this is more of an issue with inconsistency in the way Glossier marketed this product than in the product itself. I think the product is good at what it does, which is giving that dewy look and making it last throughout the day. But don’t expect any significant lasting benefits. \\n\\nSo will I continue to use this product? I will use up the bottle I have, but probably not repurchase. I just don’t see this product as a necessary part of my routine. If I want glowy skin, I’m more likely to reach for a classic highlighter like Glossier’s haloscope, and if I want a moisturizing oil, I’m more likely to reach for TO’s Rosehip oil. I’m just not reaching for Futuredew as much as I’d like to. \\n\\nOverall rating: 3.5/5 WNRP   \n",

Especially with Korean skincare, you have hyaluronic acid nearly everytime included in the product, plus you can also choose a product that has other hydrating ingredients. As well as healing, soothing or strengthening the skin barrier. \\nI like Korean skincare because it usually offers a multiple targeting of skin issues. This hyaluronic acid serum reminds me a western skincare. \\nI would rather pick something like iUNIK Beta glucan serum. Which has also calming benefits, is an antioxidant, repair skin barrier function and apparently it's ability to retain moisture is 20% better than hyaluronic acid. This serum has about 90% of all beta glucan.   \n",

Fenty is always great and they have a large color selection, plus their killawat highlights often come with 2 colors per compact so a bigger bang for your buck. \\n\\nThat said, I bought the haus labs highlighter and i will say thats been my go to since. Its a better, more modern formula than fenty, which hasnt changed much 2017 imo. They are a liiittle more on the glittery side. The haus labs compact is kinda pricy but its a ton of product and some of the colors double into the blush territory. Definitely go into store and compare.\\n\\nBenefit is pretty but i feel like you need the perfect shade for highlighters to work bc the composition of color (a silvery, copper, gold one, etc etc) will be what makes it dazzle on you. The benefit having only two shades is a bummer.   \n",

I know some have issues with the fragrance but I like my skincare to smell nice 🤷‍♀️ Their blueberry rebalancing cleanser is my HG and it devastates me that I'm struggling to get my hands on it now. It's so perfectly gentle yet actually feels like it cleanses at the same time. \\n\\nI had the joy of going to the Innisfree location in jeju and I was in heaven!   \n",

I looked at the ingredients and they look pretty safe, but with all the essential oils I wouldn’t recommend these for sensitive skin types and a lot of the products contain coconut derived ingredients which can also aggravate acne.

The Armani has a nice glow but unless you plan to touch up with powder every few hours it might not give the desired effect.\\n\\nPair the foundation with a really good skincare routine starting a few weeks out to give it time to take effect. Focus on hydration so that the matte foundation can still have a softness to it.   \n",

I absolutely love that stuff and use it every day. I put on two layers while spritzing thermal water in between to get it to really soak in. It is so hydrating and plays well with all of my other products. It also lasts forever.   \n",
       "3855  Hey I’ll try keeping this short - \\n\\nIf you mention you have extreme dryness around the eyes pls avoid using eye creams esp those with a high concentration of, say, retinol. It’ll dry it out further. \\nYou need to start by balancing the moisture in that region as well. Don’t ask me how, I’m no expert in this unfortunately. You’ll have to do some research or technically stop using the thing that may be drying out that region. \\n\\nFor dark circles, puffiness, etc (if you’re unable to stick to a sleep schedule, good diet and all) you can use any decent, well priced eye cream to reduce the _appearance_ of these. There is nothing in the market that gets rid of them, anything that claims to do so is false. \\n\\nYou don’t need to spend the amount given on this laneige product, you can go with any other trustworthy Indian brand like minimalist as well.   \n",

The only thing that helped me was Lanolips 12 hour lip mask\\nyou can also try the lip glowy balm by laneige. I think that has better hydration.   \n",

The water content should mean it’s hydrating as well. \\n\\nWhen I was repairing my skin barrier I paired it with SOS Barrier Repair cream and it was incredible. \\n\\nMaybe give it a few days. You might also want to let it dry done just a slight bit more. If it’s the silicone TO moisturizer it might be mixing weirdly, or is it possible that your skin isn’t a fan of your current moisturizer?   \n",

       "1683  So here's my two cents. Mucin does appear to have healing benefits, but for skin to be healthy, it needs to retain moisture first and foremost. I found this product far too drying. The Hyaluronic acid sucked my skin dry. However, using this as a... Serum step... And then layering an occlusive moisturizer on top might be the way to go. Perhaps this product will work better underneath something more substantial   \n",
