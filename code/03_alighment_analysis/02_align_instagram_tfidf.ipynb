       "      <td>**Skin type:** dry, closed comedone prone, hormonal acne\\n\\n**Age:** 24\\n\\n**Environment:** humid, frequent temperature changes\\n\\n**Medication:** On the pill \\n\\n**First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* 2 oz tube lasted 2 1/2 months \\n* Two words: simple and effective. Big fan of FAB as a whole because their products are alcohol and fragrance free. After moving from a humid to a dry environment, I was in need of a thicker moisturizer to prevent flakes and soothe my angry skin. FAB gets the job done without breaking the bank. When the temperature drops, I am able to use this product in the AM and PM without feeling oily. Also love that the Ultra Repair Cream has various tube size options because I don't like tub packages.                                                               \\n* Cons: Too thick to wear bare face in the summer, I end up looking oily (especially on my forehead) halfway through the day. In the process of looking for a lighter AM moisturizer for when I don't wear makeup.     \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**DR JARTS Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum (AM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 3 months with off and on usage\\n* One of the biggest perks is the dropper design. Instead of having to squeeze the product out, you just click the top to release. Application is easy and the serum feels nice and cool, a little product goes a long way. Not sure how effective it is though, redness will go away around my nose and cheeks after application but only for a limited amount of time. I was hoping the serum would help combat redness for when I go without makeup. Definitely not the answer to a quick fix. If I had an unlimited skincare budget, the Tiger Grass Serum would be a nice little luxury but for now I will not be repurchasing. \\n* Cons: The price does not justify the minimal results I have seen. I have had more success taming redness by implementing an overall more soothing routine. \\n* Repurchase: For now, no\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 1 1/2 months \\n* Needed an extra hydration boost once I added exfoliation into  my routine. Soaks in nicely, especially when I layer with a facial spray. Would need at least 2 pumps to fully cover my face. Overall, I feel like the booster did not add anything remarkable to my routine. No negative reactions or breakouts, but my skin did not feel extra hydrated. Results were the same on days I used the booster versus days I forgot to. Still looking for a serum or oil to add before/with my final moisturizer.\\n* Cons: Went through the product quickly with minimal results. Not cost effective for me to use reguarly ($20 for 1 fl oz)\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Pixi Hydrating Milky Mist (AM/PM/As Needed)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months \\n* My first facial spray! Honestly was a splurge Target purchase that happened to work out really well for my skin. I like to layer my hydrating products with it or use as an extra boost throughout the day.  I also use it as a setting spray to prevent the \"cracked foundation\" look that usually occurs with my dry skin + makeup. While I haven't tried other sprays/mists, from what I gathered it seems like most of them achieve the same results. The Milky Mist isn't a HG, but it helps with inflammation/dryness and I can easily purchase it.\\n* Cons: none\\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not pictured) (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months - Would have run out sooner, but I tested other products in between\\n* One of my first purchases when I decided to completely overhaul my skincare routine (per recommendations from this sub). Before starting chemical exfoliation, I would use this moisturizer in the AM and PM. Switched to just AM when I introduced Good Genes because it wasn't heavy enough. Feels cool and the gel sinks in quickly, no leftover residue or pilling. I wish my dry skin worked well with gel moisturizers because I love the texture! Unfortunately, it just isn't hydrating enough and I had to add other products in order for my skin to not be flakey.\\n* Cons: Pricey per oz for a drugstore product and comes in a tub. Too thin for the winter and wasn't hydrating enough under makeup.\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Glossier Milky Jelly (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted about 5 months  \\n\\n* This is actually my second bottle of Milky Jelly. Switched to this product after Cerave Hydrating cleanser wasn't quite cutting it for me. Does a great job as my second cleanser when I am wearing makeup (no need for an additional eye makeup remover). Can get away with a single cleanse on no makeup days. The scent is lovely and my skin does not feel stripped afterwards. \\n* Cons: Need an additional cleanser (right now I am using an oil) if wearing makeup. \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Bliss Mighty Marshmallow Mask (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted 1 month  \\n\\n* Product is creamy and has a sweet scent (does not bother me). Easy to apply and has a whipped texture. Would use after cleansing 1-2 times a week. My skin felt softer washing off, but I did not notice any brightening. I used the mask more for hydration.\\n* Cons: No brightening or radiance\\n* Repurchase: No</td>\n",

I use this at night, and it replenishes my skin with hydration very well. It’s super lightweight and can double up as a moisturizer because of how much hydration it provides. My skin tends to be more on the drying side, so I layer up with other products after using this as a toner. But this product can be used alone, finishing with a moisturizer, after cleansing your face. There is somewhat of a layer of residue formed after using this, but that is most likely due to the high amount of moisture this product provides. My face stays hydrated throughout the night, making my skin supple and smooth in the morning. \\n\\nHow to use:\\n\\nAfter cleansing your face, pour the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over your face. Let the product dry for a few seconds, absorbing into your skin, before applying other products.\\n\\nSkin recommendations: normal, dry</td>\n",

       "418   **Skin type:** dry, closed comedone prone, hormonal acne\\n\\n**Age:** 24\\n\\n**Environment:** humid, frequent temperature changes\\n\\n**Medication:** On the pill \\n\\n**First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* 2 oz tube lasted 2 1/2 months \\n* Two words: simple and effective. Big fan of FAB as a whole because their products are alcohol and fragrance free. After moving from a humid to a dry environment, I was in need of a thicker moisturizer to prevent flakes and soothe my angry skin. FAB gets the job done without breaking the bank. When the temperature drops, I am able to use this product in the AM and PM without feeling oily. Also love that the Ultra Repair Cream has various tube size options because I don't like tub packages.                                                               \\n* Cons: Too thick to wear bare face in the summer, I end up looking oily (especially on my forehead) halfway through the day. In the process of looking for a lighter AM moisturizer for when I don't wear makeup.     \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**DR JARTS Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum (AM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 3 months with off and on usage\\n* One of the biggest perks is the dropper design. Instead of having to squeeze the product out, you just click the top to release. Application is easy and the serum feels nice and cool, a little product goes a long way. Not sure how effective it is though, redness will go away around my nose and cheeks after application but only for a limited amount of time. I was hoping the serum would help combat redness for when I go without makeup. Definitely not the answer to a quick fix. If I had an unlimited skincare budget, the Tiger Grass Serum would be a nice little luxury but for now I will not be repurchasing. \\n* Cons: The price does not justify the minimal results I have seen. I have had more success taming redness by implementing an overall more soothing routine. \\n* Repurchase: For now, no\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 1 1/2 months \\n* Needed an extra hydration boost once I added exfoliation into  my routine. Soaks in nicely, especially when I layer with a facial spray. Would need at least 2 pumps to fully cover my face. Overall, I feel like the booster did not add anything remarkable to my routine. No negative reactions or breakouts, but my skin did not feel extra hydrated. Results were the same on days I used the booster versus days I forgot to. Still looking for a serum or oil to add before/with my final moisturizer.\\n* Cons: Went through the product quickly with minimal results. Not cost effective for me to use reguarly ($20 for 1 fl oz)\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Pixi Hydrating Milky Mist (AM/PM/As Needed)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months \\n* My first facial spray! Honestly was a splurge Target purchase that happened to work out really well for my skin. I like to layer my hydrating products with it or use as an extra boost throughout the day.  I also use it as a setting spray to prevent the \"cracked foundation\" look that usually occurs with my dry skin + makeup. While I haven't tried other sprays/mists, from what I gathered it seems like most of them achieve the same results. The Milky Mist isn't a HG, but it helps with inflammation/dryness and I can easily purchase it.\\n* Cons: none\\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not pictured) (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months - Would have run out sooner, but I tested other products in between\\n* One of my first purchases when I decided to completely overhaul my skincare routine (per recommendations from this sub). Before starting chemical exfoliation, I would use this moisturizer in the AM and PM. Switched to just AM when I introduced Good Genes because it wasn't heavy enough. Feels cool and the gel sinks in quickly, no leftover residue or pilling. I wish my dry skin worked well with gel moisturizers because I love the texture! Unfortunately, it just isn't hydrating enough and I had to add other products in order for my skin to not be flakey.\\n* Cons: Pricey per oz for a drugstore product and comes in a tub. Too thin for the winter and wasn't hydrating enough under makeup.\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Glossier Milky Jelly (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted about 5 months  \\n\\n* This is actually my second bottle of Milky Jelly. Switched to this product after Cerave Hydrating cleanser wasn't quite cutting it for me. Does a great job as my second cleanser when I am wearing makeup (no need for an additional eye makeup remover). Can get away with a single cleanse on no makeup days. The scent is lovely and my skin does not feel stripped afterwards. \\n* Cons: Need an additional cleanser (right now I am using an oil) if wearing makeup. \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Bliss Mighty Marshmallow Mask (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted 1 month  \\n\\n* Product is creamy and has a sweet scent (does not bother me). Easy to apply and has a whipped texture. Would use after cleansing 1-2 times a week. My skin felt softer washing off, but I did not notice any brightening. I used the mask more for hydration.\\n* Cons: No brightening or radiance\\n* Repurchase: No   \n",

The Innisfree has a nicer scent and texture when applying whereas the Calendula has a thicker texture and is a white color. Both seem to sink in around the same time, I pat my skin for it to absorb faster. On my nose/above my mouth, the Innisfree one feels a lot drier than the Nature Republic one. The Nature Republic one feels like I can rub it off whereas Innisfree has a better finish? Although when I sweat, it's easier to see the Innisfree. Both, when there is a droplet of sweat that rolls down my face will leave a trail as it clears away the sunblock in that area.\\n\\nHopefully someone with the California Aloe Sunblock can chime in. I'm currently using Privacy UV Face Mist SPF 50+/PA++++ 1x or 2x on my face after using the Innisfree. Otherwise my face begins to almost hurt because the skin near my nose is so taut.   \n",

This has become one of my new favorite toners, adding to my collection of holy grails. \\n\\nAbout this product:\\n\\n* consists of tocopherol (vitamin E) - an antioxidant that helps protect the skin from sun damage and has moisturizing and healing benefits.\\n* it has white tea leaf water - an anti-aging ingredient that is rich in antioxidants that protect your skin from sun damage, making your skin youthful and healthy.\\n* there is meadowfoam seed oil - a plant oil that moisturizes and soothes skin and helps protect damage from UVB rays.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nThis toner worked a lot better on my skin than I expected. I use this at night, and it replenishes my skin with hydration very well. It’s super lightweight and can double up as a moisturizer because of how much hydration it provides. My skin tends to be more on the drying side, so I layer up with other products after using this as a toner. But this product can be used alone, finishing with a moisturizer, after cleansing your face. There is somewhat of a layer of residue formed after using this, but that is most likely due to the high amount of moisture this product provides. My face stays hydrated throughout the night, making my skin supple and smooth in the morning. \\n\\nHow to use:\\n\\nAfter cleansing your face, pour the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over your face. Let the product dry for a few seconds, absorbing into your skin, before applying other products.\\n\\nSkin recommendations: normal, dry   \n",

This has become one of my new favorite toners, adding to my collection of holy grails. \\n\\nAbout this product:\\n\\n* consists of tocopherol (vitamin E) - an antioxidant that helps protect the skin from sun damage and has moisturizing and healing benefits.\\n* it has white tea leaf water - an anti-aging ingredient that is rich in antioxidants that protect your skin from sun damage, making your skin youthful and healthy.\\n* there is meadowfoam seed oil - a plant oil that moisturizes and soothes skin and helps protect damage from UVB rays.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nThis toner worked a lot better on my skin than I expected. I use this at night, and it replenishes my skin with hydration very well. It’s super lightweight and can double up as a moisturizer because of how much hydration it provides. My skin tends to be more on the drying side, so I layer up with other products after using this as a toner. But this product can be used alone, finishing with a moisturizer, after cleansing your face. There is somewhat of a layer of residue formed after using this, but that is most likely due to the high amount of moisture this product provides. My face stays hydrated throughout the night, making my skin supple and smooth in the morning. \\n\\nHow to use:\\n\\nAfter cleansing your face, pour the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over your face. Let the product dry for a few seconds, absorbing into your skin, before applying other products.\\n\\nSkin recommendations: normal, dry</td>\n",

Big fan of FAB as a whole because their products are alcohol and fragrance free. After moving from a humid to a dry environment, I was in need of a thicker moisturizer to prevent flakes and soothe my angry skin. FAB gets the job done without breaking the bank. When the temperature drops, I am able to use this product in the AM and PM without feeling oily. Also love that the Ultra Repair Cream has various tube size options because I don't like tub packages.                                                               \\n* Cons: Too thick to wear bare face in the summer, I end up looking oily (especially on my forehead) halfway through the day. In the process of looking for a lighter AM moisturizer for when I don't wear makeup.     \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**DR JARTS Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum (AM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 3 months with off and on usage\\n* One of the biggest perks is the dropper design. Instead of having to squeeze the product out, you just click the top to release. Application is easy and the serum feels nice and cool, a little product goes a long way. Not sure how effective it is though, redness will go away around my nose and cheeks after application but only for a limited amount of time. I was hoping the serum would help combat redness for when I go without makeup. Definitely not the answer to a quick fix. If I had an unlimited skincare budget, the Tiger Grass Serum would be a nice little luxury but for now I will not be repurchasing. \\n* Cons: The price does not justify the minimal results I have seen. I have had more success taming redness by implementing an overall more soothing routine. \\n* Repurchase: For now, no\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 1 1/2 months \\n* Needed an extra hydration boost once I added exfoliation into  my routine. Soaks in nicely, especially when I layer with a facial spray. Would need at least 2 pumps to fully cover my face. Overall, I feel like the booster did not add anything remarkable to my routine. No negative reactions or breakouts, but my skin did not feel extra hydrated. Results were the same on days I used the booster versus days I forgot to. Still looking for a serum or oil to add before/with my final moisturizer.\\n* Cons: Went through the product quickly with minimal results. Not cost effective for me to use reguarly ($20 for 1 fl oz)\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Pixi Hydrating Milky Mist (AM/PM/As Needed)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months \\n* My first facial spray! Honestly was a splurge Target purchase that happened to work out really well for my skin. I like to layer my hydrating products with it or use as an extra boost throughout the day.  I also use it as a setting spray to prevent the \"cracked foundation\" look that usually occurs with my dry skin + makeup. While I haven't tried other sprays/mists, from what I gathered it seems like most of them achieve the same results. The Milky Mist isn't a HG, but it helps with inflammation/dryness and I can easily purchase it.\\n* Cons: none\\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not pictured) (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months - Would have run out sooner, but I tested other products in between\\n* One of my first purchases when I decided to completely overhaul my skincare routine (per recommendations from this sub). Before starting chemical exfoliation, I would use this moisturizer in the AM and PM. Switched to just AM when I introduced Good Genes because it wasn't heavy enough. Feels cool and the gel sinks in quickly, no leftover residue or pilling. I wish my dry skin worked well with gel moisturizers because I love the texture! Unfortunately, it just isn't hydrating enough and I had to add other products in order for my skin to not be flakey.\\n* Cons: Pricey per oz for a drugstore product and comes in a tub. Too thin for the winter and wasn't hydrating enough under makeup.\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Glossier Milky Jelly (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted about 5 months  \\n\\n* This is actually my second bottle of Milky Jelly. Switched to this product after Cerave Hydrating cleanser wasn't quite cutting it for me. Does a great job as my second cleanser when I am wearing makeup (no need for an additional eye makeup remover). Can get away with a single cleanse on no makeup days. The scent is lovely and my skin does not feel stripped afterwards. \\n* Cons: Need an additional cleanser (right now I am using an oil) if wearing makeup. \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Bliss Mighty Marshmallow Mask (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted 1 month  \\n\\n* Product is creamy and has a sweet scent (does not bother me). Easy to apply and has a whipped texture. Would use after cleansing 1-2 times a week. My skin felt softer washing off, but I did not notice any brightening. I used the mask more for hydration.\\n* Cons: No brightening or radiance\\n* Repurchase: No</td>\n",

Both seem to sink in around the same time, I pat my skin for it to absorb faster. On my nose/above my mouth, the Innisfree one feels a lot drier than the Nature Republic one. The Nature Republic one feels like I can rub it off whereas Innisfree has a better finish? Although when I sweat, it's easier to see the Innisfree. Both, when there is a droplet of sweat that rolls down my face will leave a trail as it clears away the sunblock in that area.\\n\\nHopefully someone with the California Aloe Sunblock can chime in. I'm currently using Privacy UV Face Mist SPF 50+/PA++++ 1x or 2x on my face after using the Innisfree. Otherwise my face begins to almost hurt because the skin near my nose is so taut.</td>\n",

Rare beauty is hydrating if you have dry skin and Fenty is great for oily skin. I’m currently using Fenty since I need light coverage for my oily combo skin.   \n",

This has become one of my new favorite toners, adding to my collection of holy grails. \\n\\nAbout this product:\\n\\n* consists of tocopherol (vitamin E) - an antioxidant that helps protect the skin from sun damage and has moisturizing and healing benefits.\\n* it has white tea leaf water - an anti-aging ingredient that is rich in antioxidants that protect your skin from sun damage, making your skin youthful and healthy.\\n* there is meadowfoam seed oil - a plant oil that moisturizes and soothes skin and helps protect damage from UVB rays.\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nThis toner worked a lot better on my skin than I expected. I use this at night, and it replenishes my skin with hydration very well. It’s super lightweight and can double up as a moisturizer because of how much hydration it provides. My skin tends to be more on the drying side, so I layer up with other products after using this as a toner. But this product can be used alone, finishing with a moisturizer, after cleansing your face. There is somewhat of a layer of residue formed after using this, but that is most likely due to the high amount of moisture this product provides. My face stays hydrated throughout the night, making my skin supple and smooth in the morning. \\n\\nHow to use:\\n\\nAfter cleansing your face, pour the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over your face. Let the product dry for a few seconds, absorbing into your skin, before applying other products.\\n\\nSkin recommendations: normal, dry   \n",

       "418   **Skin type:** dry, closed comedone prone, hormonal acne\\n\\n**Age:** 24\\n\\n**Environment:** humid, frequent temperature changes\\n\\n**Medication:** On the pill \\n\\n**First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* 2 oz tube lasted 2 1/2 months \\n* Two words: simple and effective. Big fan of FAB as a whole because their products are alcohol and fragrance free. After moving from a humid to a dry environment, I was in need of a thicker moisturizer to prevent flakes and soothe my angry skin. FAB gets the job done without breaking the bank. When the temperature drops, I am able to use this product in the AM and PM without feeling oily. Also love that the Ultra Repair Cream has various tube size options because I don't like tub packages.                                                               \\n* Cons: Too thick to wear bare face in the summer, I end up looking oily (especially on my forehead) halfway through the day. In the process of looking for a lighter AM moisturizer for when I don't wear makeup.     \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**DR JARTS Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum (AM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 3 months with off and on usage\\n* One of the biggest perks is the dropper design. Instead of having to squeeze the product out, you just click the top to release. Application is easy and the serum feels nice and cool, a little product goes a long way. Not sure how effective it is though, redness will go away around my nose and cheeks after application but only for a limited amount of time. I was hoping the serum would help combat redness for when I go without makeup. Definitely not the answer to a quick fix. If I had an unlimited skincare budget, the Tiger Grass Serum would be a nice little luxury but for now I will not be repurchasing. \\n* Cons: The price does not justify the minimal results I have seen. I have had more success taming redness by implementing an overall more soothing routine. \\n* Repurchase: For now, no\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 1 1/2 months \\n* Needed an extra hydration boost once I added exfoliation into  my routine. Soaks in nicely, especially when I layer with a facial spray. Would need at least 2 pumps to fully cover my face. Overall, I feel like the booster did not add anything remarkable to my routine. No negative reactions or breakouts, but my skin did not feel extra hydrated. Results were the same on days I used the booster versus days I forgot to. Still looking for a serum or oil to add before/with my final moisturizer.\\n* Cons: Went through the product quickly with minimal results. Not cost effective for me to use reguarly ($20 for 1 fl oz)\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Pixi Hydrating Milky Mist (AM/PM/As Needed)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months \\n* My first facial spray! Honestly was a splurge Target purchase that happened to work out really well for my skin. I like to layer my hydrating products with it or use as an extra boost throughout the day.  I also use it as a setting spray to prevent the \"cracked foundation\" look that usually occurs with my dry skin + makeup. While I haven't tried other sprays/mists, from what I gathered it seems like most of them achieve the same results. The Milky Mist isn't a HG, but it helps with inflammation/dryness and I can easily purchase it.\\n* Cons: none\\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not pictured) (AM/PM)**\\n\\n* Lasted 4 months - Would have run out sooner, but I tested other products in between\\n* One of my first purchases when I decided to completely overhaul my skincare routine (per recommendations from this sub). Before starting chemical exfoliation, I would use this moisturizer in the AM and PM. Switched to just AM when I introduced Good Genes because it wasn't heavy enough. Feels cool and the gel sinks in quickly, no leftover residue or pilling. I wish my dry skin worked well with gel moisturizers because I love the texture! Unfortunately, it just isn't hydrating enough and I had to add other products in order for my skin to not be flakey.\\n* Cons: Pricey per oz for a drugstore product and comes in a tub. Too thin for the winter and wasn't hydrating enough under makeup.\\n* Repurchase: No\\n\\n**Glossier Milky Jelly (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted about 5 months  \\n\\n* This is actually my second bottle of Milky Jelly. Switched to this product after Cerave Hydrating cleanser wasn't quite cutting it for me. Does a great job as my second cleanser when I am wearing makeup (no need for an additional eye makeup remover). Can get away with a single cleanse on no makeup days. The scent is lovely and my skin does not feel stripped afterwards. \\n* Cons: Need an additional cleanser (right now I am using an oil) if wearing makeup. \\n* Repurchase: Yes\\n\\n**Bliss Mighty Marshmallow Mask (PM)**  \\n\\n\\n* Lasted 1 month  \\n\\n* Product is creamy and has a sweet scent (does not bother me). Easy to apply and has a whipped texture. Would use after cleansing 1-2 times a week. My skin felt softer washing off, but I did not notice any brightening. I used the mask more for hydration.\\n* Cons: No brightening or radiance\\n* Repurchase: No   \n",

The Innisfree has a nicer scent and texture when applying whereas the Calendula has a thicker texture and is a white color. Both seem to sink in around the same time, I pat my skin for it to absorb faster. On my nose/above my mouth, the Innisfree one feels a lot drier than the Nature Republic one. The Nature Republic one feels like I can rub it off whereas Innisfree has a better finish? Although when I sweat, it's easier to see the Innisfree. Both, when there is a droplet of sweat that rolls down my face will leave a trail as it clears away the sunblock in that area.\\n\\nHopefully someone with the California Aloe Sunblock can chime in. I'm currently using Privacy UV Face Mist SPF 50+/PA++++ 1x or 2x on my face after using the Innisfree. Otherwise my face begins to almost hurt because the skin near my nose is so taut.   \n",
