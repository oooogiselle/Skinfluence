I've been watching youtube since 2018 but I started with makeup even though I don't wear much and came across many people.  Then went into skincare and I'm obsessed.

I started using the Benefit oil cleanser at night because I was testing out concealers and foundations, so I was using more products recently. I must say, it\\'s an amazing oil cleanser. I haven\\'t found better. I just wish it wasn\\'t so expensive. Farmacy balm cleanser is almost as good and just a bit goes a long way. I can\\'t remember how much I paid for it b/c I got it at a 50% discount and I have had it for months. Anyway, just wanted to mention that you don\\'t need to wash your face in the morning.

It improves skin texture, naturally hydrates, evens skin tone, increases cellular turnover, speeds up wound healing, controls oil production and dandruff when I use it as a body wash.  When used as a shampoo bar, it repairs, grows hair, makes it silky smooth, locks in the style and adds bounce. It has a formula that contains not only collagen but also keratin peptides. It is called Hair & Whole Body Bar and has a formula that is fast absorbed due to its peptide binding enhancement technology which produces water molecules in a condensation reaction that hydrates skin and hair naturally. The collagen and keratin peptides not only are part of Collagen Banking but of Keratin Banking as well. This routine will prevent future loss of skin collagen that will lead to sagging, crepey and thinning skin. Skin is made up of soft keratin so keratin banking is as important as collagen banking. It repairs, grows hair, naturally moisturizes, rebuilds and strengthens hair and skin simultaneously. I got it on Amazon and you can search for Skinlyte to find it. I noticed a reduction of sagging, wrinkles and sebacious filaments. It has added volume to my hair and has made my skin very smooth and elastic. I also noticed that my hairline is fuller. What I like best about it is that it's all natural and without harmful and irritating chemicals such as synthetic dyes, fragrance, SLS or preservatives.\",\n",

It creates trauma like the retinal a does but also incorporates ur own plasma to encourage healing by ur own biological system to encourage an entire newer layer of skin… SO TO SPEAK. \\n\\nIt isn’t actually new… but it’s fairly new to general population that could afford like myself at $600 a pop and can last up to 12-18 months \\n\\n\\nSo please advise from ur own research and also why haven’t u tried urself OR if have tired it, please send me the link to the video.\\n\\nIn all the years I have followed u, this is my first attempt to contact u. \\nI’ve searched repeatedly and haven’t found any advice positive or negative for the PRP Facial or Vampire Facial. \\n\\nPlease and thank u so greatly dear Angie.\\n\\nEven if I don’t find ur help here… my goodness dear one… u have helped me find my confidence that I was slowly losing!\\n\\nEven without ur , expertly fair and true assistance with anti-aging… u helped me realize I wasn’t alone \\n\\nB4 finding ur channel, I’d looked for about a solid year… that’s AFTER asking, counter to counter from make up “ experts” and asking friend  and colleges to find they had same problem with zero guidance! \\n\\nUr a kind soul who became empowered by your own need and lack of knowledge from anyone else… so u, being braver than rest of us, decided to figure it out yourself and I’m so glad u took me and rest of us all, along with u on your journey!!! \\n\\nU r very loved and appreciated!\\nVampire facial advice or no! \\n\\nI love love love u and am so grateful u haven’t left after youtube has “ changed” \\nI won’t say targeted, but at least let us all down whom have followed and appreciated ur channel even if ONLY or very few reasons to even view youtube … I mean daily. \\nOf course I view YouTube regularly.

I have used Ivory soap (bar) my entire life (61 in August) and have always had a clear complexion.  I follow up with a moisturizer with retinol at night, but use a foundation with sunscreen each morning.  Recently, Ivory has changed their production.  It is no longer whipped with air and does not float.  Disappointing, but the formula remains the same as far as I can tell.  I went in for some Botox and fillers for my 60th birthday and she said I needed minimal attention.  She absolutely wanted to know what my skincare routine was.  Other than Ivory twice a day, Neutrogena vitamin C capsules once per week , Neutrogena retinol at night and Paula's Choice Exfoliant once per week, the only other beneficial element is the Louisiana humidity I was raised with.  There's an old saying, Louisiana girls don't sweat, they glisten.  The treatment I received over a year ago has held up wonderfully, and I don't feel the need for tweaks yet.  Just wanted to say that I love your stuff, and can't wait for more.  So far, so good y'all ❤\",\n",

The texture of the cloth can also provide gentle exfoliation, removing dead skin cells. \\nEnhanced Skincare Absorption:\\nBy opening pores, warm cloths can help skincare products penetrate more deeply, allowing for better absorption and effectiveness. \\nHydration:\\nWarmth can help increase oil production, naturally moisturizing the skin. \\nSoothing and Relieving Tension:\\nHot towels can be used to relieve tired eyes, tight shoulders, or headaches. \\nAffordable and Versatile:\\nHot towels are an accessible and budget-friendly skincare option that can be used for various purposes. \\n__________________________\\nThe steamer\\n\\nDeep Cleansing: Steam helps to open pores, allowing for a more thorough cleansing by loosening dirt, oil, and debris. \\nIncreased Circulation: The heat from steaming dilates blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the skin. This can help deliver more oxygen and nutrients to skin cells, potentially boosting collagen and elastin production, which can improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. \\nHydration: Steam can help hydrate the skin, particularly beneficial for those with dry or dehydrated skin. \\nImproved Product Absorption: Steaming can make the skin more permeable, allowing for better absorption of topical products. \\nAcne Relief: By opening pores and potentially releasing trapped sebum and acne-causing bacteria, steaming can help reduce acne and inflammation. \\nEnhanced Exfoliation: Steam can soften the skin, making it easier to exfoliate. \\nRelief of Sinus Congestion: Steam can also help relieve sinus congestion. \\n__________________________\\nAnd that’s why it is not a “useless” machine like he said \\n\\n(This is just because why not?

Don't you think that अंत:करण should also be शुद्ध?\\nBeauty resides in brain and behavior. Your behavior and actions makes a difference.\\n Personality is also very important but should be a pleasing one. Pleasing personality means a smile on your face, eyes should be sparkling, you should be happy from inside. Personality becomes your first impression so you definitely need to have strong personality but Your मन should be beautiful and शुद्ध.Be pure  from within, and it will naturally reflect on your face.\\nFocusing on दिखावा  and outer beauty without having inner purity doesn't suffice. For Instance once you put on make-up for any function like wedding, but once that is over you will remove your make-up, your face remains same.\\nRefer 1st Adhya,22nd Shlok of Srimad Bhagwat Geeta:\\nयावदेतान्निरिकीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकमानवस्थितान् | \\n कैर्मया सह योद्धव्यमस्मिन् रणसमुद्यमे || २२||\\nHere Arjun addresses the Lord as Achyuta earlier and said please take my chariot to the middle of both armies, so that I may look at the warriors gathered for battle, whom I must fight. Here he is  focusing on “देह” that is the outer presence. So here is looking through चर्म चक्षु. \\nBut later on in 23rd Shlok\\nयोत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागता: |\\nधार्तराष्ट्रस्य दुर्बुद्धेर्युद्धे प्रियचिकीर्षव: || 23||\\nHere Arjun desires to see those who have come here to fight on the side of the evil-buddhi son of Dhritarasthra ie Duryodhan, trying to make him happy. Here is looking through his बुद्धी चक्षु or मन चक्षु. So comparing two shlokas first he focusses on deh and then looks through बुद्धी चक्षु. Even in lokik world this applies, if you just look good but your behavior and actions are not good no one will like you.\\nAlso its amazing that though our technology is so advanced but can any one prepare skin ?any nerves? generate blood? No Right! Only परमात्मा can do so  give importance to परमात्मा . \\nSo both your inner and outer personality are important. But instead of involving your time in un-necessary things, invest your time in chanting.\\nI am writing by blessings of Srikrishna and SriSadGuru without any selfish motives. Requesting you to give a thought.\\nHari Om Tat Sat.\",\n",

It will improve skin texture, naturally hydrate, even skin tone, increase cellular turnover, speed up wound healing, control oil production and dandruff when used as a body wash.  When used as a shampoo bar, it will repair, grow hair and speed up the healing process for transplanted hair. It has a formula that contains not only collagen but also keratin peptides.  It is called Hair & Whole Body Bar and has a formula that is fast absorbed due to its peptide binding enhancement technology which produces water molecules in a condensation reaction that hydrates skin and hair naturally.  The collagen and keratin peptides not only are part of Collagen Banking but of Keratin Banking as well.  This routine will prevent future loss of skin collagen that will lead to sagging, crepey and thinning skin. Skin is made up of soft keratin so keratin banking is as important as collagen banking.  It repairs, grows hair, naturally moisturizes, rebuilds and strengthens hair and skin simultaneously.  Search on Amazon for Skinlyte to find it.  I noticed many improvements in my hair, skin and nails.  What I like best about it is that it's all natural and without harmful and irritating chemicals such as synthetic dyes, fragrance, SLS or preservatives.\",\n",

You are shopping at your local mall and it is almost closing time. Hailey brings up an idea to try to stay after hours at the mall. You are too scared to do it but Hailey is your only ride home.\\r\\n\\r\\n#1: The final closing announcement is heard in the store you are in. If you don't want to get caught you have to hide. Which store are you hiding in?\\r\\n\\r\\na) Sephora\\r\\nb) Hair Salon\\r\\nc) Clothing Store\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n........................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) ❤: There wasn't enough space for you and your friends to hide, and you got caught. You were killed by your parents.\\r\\nb) 💛: You hid with all the supplies in the break room, but were very close to being found.\\r\\nc) 💚: You were safe because you and your friends hid in clothing racks during closing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#2: After all the security guards left you needed to find food because you and your friends were hungry. You walk into a candy shop and grab some things you like. What do you do next?\\r\\n\\r\\na) Make it look like someone robbed the store at night and you left without paying.\\r\\nb) Leave a $10 bill which is more than enough to pay for the things you took.\\r\\nc) Grab only a little bit of candy so the owner doesn't notice anything and leave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n............................................................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) ❤: The security guard hears the commotion and finds you and your friends.\\r\\nb) 💚: Your sense of decency saved you and your friends from whatever consequences would have come if you hadn't paid.\\r\\nc) 💛: You are safe for the night and nobody is hurt. For now...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#3: Hailey gets a notification on her phone that is from her mother. You three have to make up a lie that will save all of you from your parents. What do you do?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) Tell Hailey's mom that you will be back in the morning and that you are sleeping over at another friend's house.\\r\\nb) Tell Hailey's mom you were sleeping over at Samantha's house for the night.\\r\\nc) Ignore the text.\\r\\n\\r\\n...............................................................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) 💛: You were close to death, but luckily Hailey's mom is very chill, so she didn't ask any follow-up questions.\\r\\nb) ❤: Her mom wasn't questioning anything, but texted Samantha's mom to ask how the girls were doing. You all were killed the next day.\\r\\nc) 💛: Close call on ignoring her, but she just thought you were busy and didn't ask anything again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#4: It's getting late and you made a pile of clothes to sleep on that are hidden away. Samantha can't sleep and Hailey's snoring is preventing you from sleeping. What do you do?\\r\\n\\r\\na) Relax a bit and try to sleep again.\\r\\nb) Stay awake and scroll on your phone.\\r\\nc) Walk around the different stores and leave your friends in the clothing store.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n......................................................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) 💚: You ended up fast asleep in 2 minutes, and so did Samantha, you are safe tonight.\\r\\nb) ❤: A security guard saw the light from your phone and took you all into the jail under the mall.\\r\\nc) ❤: You died because a mysterious figure attacked you and nobody was there to help you.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#5: It is around 4:45 am and you hear a loud bang. Somehow only you wake up and everyone else is fast asleep. You decide to wake up your friends and explore the sound. What do you do next?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) You go downstairs to the main area where you can see almost everywhere on the first floor.\\r\\nb) You each separate and go into different stores searching for the source of the noise.\\r\\nc) You stay on the second floor and explore quietly making sure everyone is safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n...................................................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) ❤: Staying in the main area leaves you open to anything around you including security guards.\\r\\nb) ❤: Welp you died, never go alone in a horror game/movie.\\r\\nc) 💛: This is the best option even though it is quite dangerous to leave your spot in general. Staying together is good.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#6: You and your friends figure out the sound was caused by a bookshelf falling in the bookstore, but you were seen by a security guard after figuring this out. What do you do?\\r\\n\\r\\na) Run.\\r\\nb) Hide.\\r\\nc) Throw books at the security guard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n......................................................\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na) 💛: You got away but you were out of breath and Samantha had trouble turning on the car which led to a close chase with the guard.\\r\\nb) 💚: You hid in one of the aisles and the security guard got confused and ran out of the store looking for you.\\r\\nc) 💛: The books slowed the security guard down, but they made him angrier. You still managed to escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCongrats if you had made it this far! You and your friends escaped the mall! This took me about an hour and a half so please like my comment. <3\",\n",

Does one side is lower then other? its kept proportionate by परमात्मा.Surrender to परमात्मा and not to maintenance of the body. Invest your time in chanting. Understand “मौनातले बोलणे”means when you message, the message speaks what have in your mind.\\nReflect on the structure of the heart within the rib’s cage; if reversed, it depicts a lotus flower, delicately settled between the ribs without any external support. Even rib’s cage is अव्यक्त.Similarly, understand the placement of the lungs, meticulously positioned to retain the entire respiratory system.\\nEach individual has a pair of eyes, a pair of ears, singular nose and similarly other body parts. So Uniformity resides in this aspect across all individuals without any exception.

Here Wood is तत्त्व.We all come in diverse shapes and forms, much like the variety you see in furniture, but being made from the same basic materials. So You are God-made.\\nFor instance Just as when you visit a shop and ask for your necessities like groceries or vegetables. In similar manner what  you ask in ब्रह्म you receive it. When you offer prayers to the Devi, she with out fail protects you. \\nChanting any devotional Stotras like Srilalita Panchratnam,SriLalita Sahastranam,Sri Mahishasur mardini,Sri Durga Kavach,Sri Durga Chalisa can have profound effects on our skin and overall well-being.

Recently, I started using their kit, which includes a face wash, day serum, and night cream—and it’s a total game-changer! 😍 The face wash deeply cleanses without drying out my skin, the day serum keeps my skin hydrated and glowing all day, and the night cream works overnight to nourish and brighten my skin. This combo has completely transformed my skincare routine! Highly recommend! 💯✨',\n",

       " 'Zg86e9b1pag': ['Face masks reviewed . Explanation here 👇\\n\\n▪️Loreal hydrating revitalift sheet mask \\nThis sheet mask with hyaluronic  acid feels moisturising on the skin and also makes skin look plumped up. Sheet masks are a good option if you want that extra hydration to the skin. There is no benefit in using it regularly besides the fact that it creates so much waste. As with all sheet masks, save it for special  occasions or when you want a quick skin pick me up. \\n\\n▪️Himalaya pollution detox charcoal face pack \\n Charcoal is the most overstated non performing skin care ingredient. You don’t need any charcoal on your face. \\n\\n▪️Mama earth C 3 face mask\\nThis combination of charcoal, coffee and clay sounds good on paper but is not great for skin. It is better to use just a home make fruit pack over this. Or just use bentonite clay with rose water and glycerine if you like using mad packs. \\n\\n▪️Skin Q acne control mask \\nThis is a good mask if you have acne prone skin. If you have combination skin, use it only in T zone area. This helps to reduce appearance of pores and also reduces acne. \\n\\n ▪️Dot and key cica calming rapid relief face mask\\nIf you are someone with dry sensitive. Skin and want to try out a mask for relaxation, then this is a good choice. It is gentle on the skin and  leaves skin feeling less red and moisturised. \\n\\n▪️Jovees activated charcoal detoxifying face masque \\nOk charcoal should stop now. This does nothing to you skin. So avoid \\n\\n▪️Bella vita organic kumkumadi face scrub mask \\nAvoid it. Just seeing walnut shell on the ingredient list, sends a shiver down my spine. There are better face mask in the market for normal to dry skin. For one you can make a mask with ripe banana, curd,  glycerine and rose water at home. \\n\\n ▪️82 east manjishtha mud clarifying mask \\nFor such a steep price point , this is absolutely not worth it. It is better to use a gentle chemical exfoliant if have  oily skin. \\n\\n⚠️Disclaimer: this is for educational purpose only.

       "  \"This is my routine that prevents acne from coming back. The one product that I use now and that made that huge difference in my skin is the Hair & Whole Body Bar by Skinlyte. It took care of the excess oil production and sebacious filaments in my pores as it's a sulfur based glycerin soap with collagen and keratin peptides. Sulfur is a natural antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral. It got rid of the demodex mites that feed on the sebum and dead skin cells on my face and body. Sulfur is also a mild exfoliant and will help you shed the dead skin cells to prevent the mites from feeding from it and growing rapidly. Sulfur is all natural and dermatologists hate to prescribe it because it is cheap and does not provide them with any incentives. The collagen and keratin peptides sped up skin cell repair and regeneration on my face to prevent it from thinning years later (craters). After washing, I apply a french clay mask and leave it on for about 10-15 minutes. It absorbs excess oil production and brings circulation closer to the skin's surface. Get the french clay powder on Amazon and mix it with water to make your own mask. I got the Hair & Whole Body Bar on Amazon and you can find it by searching for Skinlyte. This soap is so versatile that I use it as a serum and weightless facial mask after washing with it to keep it moisturized and acne free. By following this routine, your pores will be so clean that you will feel the air around your face. Your face will also be completely clear in about 1 month without the use of Accutane or any expensive prescription treatments. The best part is that the bar is all natural and without any synthetic fragrance or colors.\",\n",

I was struggling with excessive hair fall, and to be honest, it was getting really frustrating. I tried several products, but nothing seemed to work. I was getting really stressed about it, and my confidence was taking a hit. But thanks to you on your  recommendation, I decided to give this serum a try! I'd seen you rave about it, and I trusted your opinion. And I'm so glad I did! My hair absolutely loves it! The Wishcare Hair Growth Serum has made a noticeable difference in reducing hair fall and promoting healthy hair growth. My hair looks thicker, shinier, and healthier than ever before ! Thanks Chetali ❤for introducing me to this amazing product! I'm so grateful for your recommendation😊\",\n",

It will improve skin texture, naturally hydrate, even skin tone, increase cellular turnover, speed up wound healing, control oil production and dandruff when used as a body wash.  When used as a shampoo bar, it will repair, grow hair and speed up the healing process for transplanted hair. It has a formula that contains not only collagen but also keratin peptides.  It is called Hair & Whole Body Bar and has a formula that is fast absorbed due to its peptide binding enhancement technology which produces water molecules in a condensation reaction that hydrates skin and hair naturally.  The collagen and keratin peptides not only are part of Collagen Banking but of Keratin Banking as well.  This routine will prevent future loss of skin collagen that will lead to sagging, crepey and thinning skin. Skin is made up of soft keratin so keratin banking is as important as collagen banking.  It repairs, grows hair, naturally moisturizes, rebuilds and strengthens hair and skin simultaneously.  Search on Amazon for Skinlyte to find it.  I noticed many improvements in my hair, skin and nails.  What I like best about it is that it's all natural and without harmful and irritating chemicals such as synthetic dyes, fragrance, SLS or preservatives.\",\n",

Anyhow, my skin loves ceramides, so I also always have Dr. Jart’s Ceramidin Cream in my skincare cabinet - another piece of advice from Hirons over 10 years ago.

       "  \"The best skincare product for mature skin that I have ever used has a multi peptide collagen and keratin treatment with growth factors.  It will improve skin texture, naturally hydrate, even skin tone, increase cellular turnover, speed up wound healing, control oil production and dandruff when used as a body wash.  When used as a shampoo bar, it will repair, grow hair, make it silky smooth, lock in the style and add bounce.  It also speeds up the healing process for newly transplanted hair. It has a formula that contains not only collagen but also keratin peptides.  It is called Hair & Whole Body Bar and has a formula that is fast absorbed due to its peptide binding enhancement technology which produces water molecules in a condensation reaction that hydrates skin and hair naturally.  The collagen and keratin peptides not only are part of Collagen Banking but of Keratin Banking as well.  This routine will prevent future loss of skin collagen that will lead to sagging, crepey and thinning skin. Skin is made up of soft keratin so keratin banking is as important as collagen banking.  It repairs, grows hair, naturally moisturizes, rebuilds and strengthens hair and skin simultaneously.  Search on Amazon for Skinlyte to find it.  I noticed many improvements in my hair, skin and nails.  What I like best about it is that it's all natural and without harmful and irritating chemicals such as synthetic dyes, fragrance, SLS or preservatives.\",\n",

That said GFs can have issues for those with a risk of skin cancers and I am waiting for a bit more longevity of usage by people to see if those issues are replicated by the plant versions.  The other thing is that I can only slap so much on my face and my highly reactive skin rebels when using too many different ingredients and formulas.  I'm almost finished the 2nd bottle of G&G peptide serum and truly don't see much difference having used two bottles.  I'm probably going to use another ingredient in my morning routine and not buy a third.  I don't get on with the ordinary copper peptide serum at all (caused a rosacea flare), but I did like the Dr Roebucks version I had once before, so I might try yours instead - copper peptide did make my face feel a little firmer when used previously.

But i love the texture, finish (not matte but not crazy dewy), feel and moisturising quality in all of them. \\n\\nI also tend to stick to the budget options because you go through a standard 50ml tube in a snap and so have to repurchase frequently. That's why i havent tried for example The House of Hur, Tocobo, D'alba (expensive af👀) or the Make Prem ones although i might probably like them. \\n\\nBtw there is a fragrance free version of that Isehan sunkiller one, it's Isehan Kiss me mommy (ment for children apparently) but from what i've heard it's got basically the same texture and is similar in feel to the scinic one. Amanda (forgot her last name) here on youtube raves about it all the time and has a similar Korean sunscreen video up like this one.\\n\\nFrom all of these i'm most interested to try the Numbuzin, Verdio and maybe those Skin Aqua ones, although heavy amount of alcohol dries out my skin so i'm hesitant. Also wanna try that new BOJ aqua fresh one. I'm surprised of you're despriction of it cause other youtubers have described it pretty much the opposite, a more lightweight and not as dewy version of the og rice one😄 So wanna find out what's it all about and cause i like the og one so much!\\n\\nLastly, (i know this comment is a short novel but i'm very passionate about Asian sunscreen/cosmetics😁) as much as i love the brand Haru haru (their black rice toner & essence ahh❤) and i so wanted to love their sunscreen cause it's got the rice in it, no fragrance and everything seemed ideal but i was left underwhelmed by it for the same reasons you mentioned. It's too thick to my taste (compared to all the others mentioned) almost felt matte on my skin (i have a combo/mature 36 year old skin that needs hydration and moisture) and i find the pump bottle inconvinient since the consistency is so thick it's hard to get the right amount (the two finger method) out evenly...maybe i'm the only one who's bothered by this but anywhoo, sadly haven't repurchased that one since first trying it.\\n\\nKudos for those who made it to the end of this comment!!😂 i applaud you👏🏼💕\",\n",

       "  \"I have normal to dry skin and used Skin1004 Madagascar SPF and Isntree (the ones you showed) - I preferred Skin1004 more. However I did get some suntan and with that pigmentation with both of them in summer. Now I am trying Haruharu mineral spf and it dries me out pretty badly! \\nI also use T'else - Red Orange Niacinamide Moisture Sun Cream SPF 50+ PA++++ but not sure it is good protection either - see a tiny bit of suntan line along the jawline and it is not summer yet...\\nI am on the lookout for a nice mineral or hybrid spf without alcohol which would be nicely moisturizing. \\nWill try the Mermaid one - sounded pretty good.\\nGreat review! Thank you!\",\n",
       "  'honestly the amount of detail abbey goes into for each product is sooooo my hyper fixation tea so i can watch hours of this \\n\\nthats why unpopular opinion: i understand wanting a summarized version at the end but lets be real, most people would skip to the end for that and all that hard work goes down the drain…. i don’t think its hard to take a little bit of notes and give back some effort to abbey especially as her subscriber for all the extensive research you’re all receiving from her (this is just like a lecture yall bc well…IT IS)\\n\\n(ps. i have ADHD so i’m also not the most focused person/student)\\n\\nrecommendation for viewers: \\n\\n1. look through the chapter breakdown of the video. it can help you find a specific sunscreen you’re interested in (maybe you can even decide whether you want a japanese or korean sunscreen to narrow it further) \\n\\n2. after that if you can’t focus, prioritize finish (this video is actually divided into categories of finish) and feel because i’d assume that’s the main things people look out for. don’t mind ingredients too much if you’re not ingredients-focused because abbey will point out potentially harmful ones anyway. \\n\\nthanks for all that you do, Abbey! i will always love your videos ❤',\n",

I am following cgm for 2 months now and my scalp gets very greasy quite quickly, but it was greasy before the cgm too and I have a 2b and 2c type curls - it was greasy on my scalp and I had dry ends of my hair. I can see that cgm helps my hair but not to a scalp.. Lots of cgm followers told me it's a natural process as my hair was used to sulphate shampoos with harsh ingredients and it might even take 6 months until my scalp ''calms down'' - is that true?
