I‚Äôve dealt with hyper pigmentation and dry skin my whole life and these two products are now my holy grails!,Est√©e Lauder,SkincareAddiction,"Here is my Daily Routine:

In the AM/PM
1.) I use 3 pumps of the Clinique Take Off the Day Cleansing Oil (purple bottle) and rub it all over my face. This product can be used on all skin types so my oily friends don‚Äôt need to worry! 
2.) I wash the oil off my face with a warm wash cloth
3.) I then wash my face with a Caress Daily Silk Beauty Bar, for regular ol bar soap really cleanses my skin and is so gentle! 
3.) I dry my face with a towel and put on two drops of my Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair all over my face! A little bit goes a longgggg way! Plus I try to conserve it due to the priciness of the product! 
4.) Once that‚Äôs rubbed in I let it sit until it‚Äôs dry (has a kinda tacky feel to it) and then I put on a dime and a half (I have dry skin so I feel as if my skin needs more than just a dime lol) of the SUNDAY RILEY Tidal Cream! 

That‚Äôs it!! I repeat the same step at night as well! 

My skin type was dry/normal and now since using these products it‚Äôs mostly normal with a few dry patches appearing only when I haven‚Äôt exfoliated!

I exfoliate every 3 days using Skin Medica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser!!!

If you have any further questions let me know I‚Äôd love to answer them!!!

EDIT!!!
I use Kiehl‚Äôs Super Fluid Daily UV Defense Sunscreen with SPF 50 on my face in between the Advanced Night Repair serum and applying the Tidal cream!!! The sunscreen is a bit ashy but most are with my skin complexion. If you all have any other great suggestions for sunscreens I could use that would be awesome!

xyfyv9,[Product Question] Is there an eye repair cream out there that works EVEN BETTER than these Est√©e Lauder holy grails? I‚Äôm willing spend any amount of money for my poor irritated eyelids,Est√©e Lauder,SkincareAddiction,"I‚Äôm required to wear makeup five days a week for 10-11 hours a day and it really takes a toll on my eyelids. They become so sensitive by the time I remove my makeup at the end of the day that they burn. I‚Äôve experimented with a lot of different well reputed makeup brands because I thought maybe I was allergic to something, but it happens with any eye makeup. It‚Äôs just that my eyelids are sensitive. 

After trying a couple of different popular inexpensive creams to repair my irritated eyelids like cerave, aquaphor, (which made NO difference or even worsened them), these $70 Est√©e Lauder creams where the only savior that healed my eyelids to be able to wear makeup again the next day. 

Unfortunately with longer hours at work, even these products are not cutting it anymore, as amazing as they are. 

Is there any eye cream or ointment out there that gave you *even better* results than these Est√©e Lauder eye repair products.

I‚Äôm willing spend any amount of money for my poor irritated eyelids,Est√©e Lauder,SkincareAddiction,"I cant recommend an alternative moisturizer but you might have some options to minimize irritation.

1)  zinc is anti inflammatory so I actually use the blue lizard sensitive face mineral sunscreen on parts of my face that are feeling irritated overnight and it helps a lot.  Since its mineral its less likely to sneak in your eye or agitate it and can heal while you sleep.  

2)  you might be able to reduce the make up irritating your eyes.  Maybe you can go way more intense on lipstick and big earrings to distract from a minimal eye.  Or maybe magnetic bold eyelashes to eliminate mascara and Hawaiian hands makes a tinted sunscreen stick which has zinc for inflammation and coconut oil for moisturizer.   I often use this as concealer.  I have a thing about taking off my mascara at the end of the day so I use all these things to avoid putting it on at all.

I‚Äôm sure they will tell you to stop with the makeup, but maybe explain that‚Äôs not an option when you make the appointment. 

The Advanced Night Repair has mica, which is already in eye makeup so that may be why its no longer helping. SkinCeuticals Epidermal Repair Cream might be an option. Have you tried anything made for eczema around the eyes?

There are a couple of conditions that could be worsened by creams and because of the risk to vision, getting checked by an ophthalmologist or derm would be ideal. It may be something very treatable with an antibiotic or corticosteroid.  

Are you using a primer for your shadow? Some of them can be drying. I know it doesn‚Äôt work as well but have you tried just using concealer?  They are not ideal shadows but can you use something like Burts Bees or Almay shadows to give your lids a break for a few weeks? 

I think someone already asked about eye makeup remover. Are you rinsing the remover? When mine are irritated I do a warm compress on them after washing my face. Ive found cotton balls to be softer than cotton pads. 

Also, what about brushes? How are you cleaning them? The naptha in some brush cleaners can make things worse. I use Jessup brushes and wash them every day with Dr. Bronners bar soap. They dry by morning and while I‚Äôm a sucker for handmade brushes, I switched to them so I can clean them daily.

I use the Night Repair serum in mornings, and on nights when I don‚Äôt use tretinoin. I prefer pairing the tret with serums like The Ordinary Niacinimide, since I know those actives work better together. 

Est√©e Lauder‚Äôs serum is INCREDIBLE, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily work better when applied with tretinoin (IMO) so I use it during every other routine. 

Although to answer your question, apply serums before tretinoin. Thin products, then thick. EL is indeed thicker than TO, but it‚Äôs still a serum so it‚Äôs thinner and should be absorbed onto clean skin before you apply your gooey retinol. If you decide to keep using it with your tret routine, that is. (If I were you, I‚Äôd stick with your The Ordinary serum with tret, and use the Night Repair for non-tret nights and mornings.)

I have found that if I put a serum after my retinol (tretinoin) they sort of mix together and it's as if my tret comes out of my skin (goes white again).    I serum first then tretinoin and that rubs in so much easier. 

I only use my retinol every other night so I use my Estee on my night off and another serum with my retinol (I'm using The Ordinary Buffet).

I've also found that effective ingredients in efficient concentrations are worth the money (and the headache, in the case of retinoids). Also, I agree on one-note products such as the TO - they're great for testing your compatibility with an ingredient, and they can be a great addiction to one's routine, if said routine is a complex one. Otherwise, it's unrealistic to expect some great effect from a one-note product, and you'd probably be better off with a complex, well-formulated one, even if it's a bit more expensive. If you know your actives, what they do, and what you need, and how to compensate for what a one-note product lacks, then yeah, they can be a wonderful addition to a routine.  


 I also resonate with your principle that many of one brand's products can be wonderful, but that doesn't mean all of them are the absolute best you can get for that money on the market, and you shouldn't experiment a bit with finding cheaper alternatives that do the same thing (otherwise, it's a trade-down). Paula's Choice was for me what Drunk Elephant was for you. Their products have always agreed wonderfully with my skin, and made a visible difference. But I'm still experimenting with alternatives for some of them, because if I can find ones that do the same, for less money, why the hell wouldn't I want that? I've found excellent replacements for their cleansers, serums, and nighttime moisturizers, and now I'm experimenting with some things for a toner. The only thing of theirs I've never bumped from my routine are the sunscreen moisturizers.

I feel differently to celebrity makeup brands because the products' success are more dependent on the aesthetic that the celebrity face puts out.

With skincare, the products' success is based more on actual results (as in, positive changes made to the skin's surface). Unless Fenty seems to have put in lots of R&D pre-launch and the products get genuinely good reviews like the makeup did, I'm not holding my breath for this launch as I do other celebrity skincare launches.

One, it turns out that the odd burning sensation that I mentioned is eczema! So, for the reviews that mention that, ignore what I said.

Secondly, I have found through some trial and error that zinc triggers or worsens the eczema on my face. I reason that my severe reaction to the Mint sunscreen was a severe eczema flare.

Thirdly, I mentioned in the Eucerin Oil Control and Up & Up stick sunscreens that they didn't sting my eyes. Unfortunately, through more testing, I can say that both of these sunscreens do sting my eyes. ‚òπÔ∏è",edit things note learned since posting one turns odd burning sensation mentioned eczema reviews mention ignore said secondly found trial error zinc triggers worsens eczema face reason severe reaction mint sunscreen severe eczema flare thirdly mentioned eucerin oil control stick sunscreens sting eyes unfortunately testing say sunscreens sting eyes

9mfjlr,"[product question] Does Tretinoin replace the need for AHAs, BHAs, and combination-of-both (ex. Tarte Knockout) products?",Tarte,SkincareAddiction,"Tretinoin works in an entirely different way from AHAs and BHAs. In fact, it's pretty common for people to use both tretinoin and AHAs together (after the skin has fully acclimated to daily tretinoin use of course). Basically, tretinoin increases the rate of skin cell turnover. AHAs help dissolve the ""glue"" between skin cells and helps them shed faster. So you can pretty much think of tretinoin as working from the inside out and AHAs working at the surface level. I don't really hear about people using BHAs with tretinoin though. Probably because BHAs are typically geared for helping with acne, which tretinoin often handles by itself.",tretinoin works entirely different way ahas bhas fact pretty common people use tretinoin ahas together skin fully acclimated daily tretinoin use course basically tretinoin increases rate skin cell turnover ahas help dissolve glue skin cells helps shed faster pretty much think tretinoin working inside ahas working surface level really hear people using bhas tretinoin though probably bhas typically geared helping acne tretinoin often handles

88udt2,[Product Question] Glossier priming moisturizer,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"To preface, I have dry/dehydrated and sensitive skin. I've tried a lot of primers. I cannot use any silicone based primers, as I find that they do not prolong the wear of makeup on my skin at all, and I find water based primers generally make makeup sit better/last longer on my skin.

The priming moisturizer is my HG. I have used it solely as a one-step 2in1 hydration/priming layer, and I have also used it over top another moisturizer. The latter I do usually in the winter months, or on days in which I skipped my night routine (late work nights!).

As a moisturizer, I find it to be very hydrating. It leave my skin looking plump and dewy. It also works well over serums (I use the Hylamide Sensitive Booster/TO Marine Hyaluronics/TO Reversatrol/DE C-Firma underneath), and like I stated earlier, over other moisturizers. As a primer, I find that it prolongs the longevity of my foundations/bb creams (I've used it with the Glossier Skin Tint, Nars Sheer Glow, Bare Minerals Complexion Rescue & The Ordinary's Serum Foundation), and it makes a great base for application as it eliminates any dry patches, and personally for me it fills in my smile lines. I actually haven't had any dry patches or any issues with foundation/powder settling into my smile lines since incorporating it into my routine. 

I've been using my current tube since September - almost done it, have been using it almost daily. A little goes a long way. I already have a backup, as well as multiple foil packets of it that I like to use for travel. 

Now, as a word of caution, it does have Retinyl Palmitate, which is an ester of retinol and palmitic acid. It's like the 22nd ingredient or so, but nonetheless, it would be best to ensure that SPF is incorporated into your routine if it's not there already.",preface dry dehydrated sensitive skin tried lot primers use silicone based primers find prolong wear makeup skin find water based primers generally make makeup sit better last longer skin priming moisturizer hg used solely one step hydration priming layer also used top another moisturizer latter usually winter months days skipped night routine late work nights moisturizer find hydrating leave skin looking plump dewy also works well serums use hylamide sensitive booster marine hyaluronics reversatrol de c firma underneath like stated earlier moisturizers primer find prolongs longevity foundations bb creams used glossier skin tint nars sheer glow bare minerals complexion rescue ordinary serum foundation makes great base application eliminates dry patches personally fills smile lines actually dry patches issues foundation powder settling smile lines since incorporating routine using current tube since september almost done using almost daily little goes long way already backup well multiple foil packets like use travel word caution retinyl palmitate ester retinol palmitic acid like nd ingredient nonetheless would best ensure spf incorporated routine already

f5zbjm,[Review] Glossier Futuredew,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"Product name: Glossier Futuredew

Price: $30 CAD/$24 USD for 30 mL

Warning: long review ahead!

When I was deciding whether to buy this, I didn‚Äôt find many reviews, so now that I‚Äôve been using it for a while, I thought I‚Äôd post a review in case anyone else was interested. I‚Äôve been using this product for about 6 weeks. 

Glossier describes this product as an ‚Äúoil serum hybrid‚Äù - it contains Jojoba, Grape Seed, Evening Primrose, and Rosehip Oils, as well as Squalane and Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract (fruit extract known to visibly increase brightness). It also contains mica to help give it that glowy, reflective finish. 

Glossier suggests applying this as the last step in your skincare routine (after sunscreen), which initially had me a bit confused, since usually sunscreen would be the last step in my skincare routine. But what I‚Äôve now realized is that this product is not just skincare - it‚Äôs more like a skincare/makeup combo (and in my opinion, leans more towards makeup than skincare - more on that later). 

This product dispenses as a peach-coloured serum with a slight pearly sheen. When applied to my face, it‚Äôs not oily or greasy like some face oils, but it definitely has a slight wet/sticky feeling on the face, which does fade slightly after a few minutes as the product absorbs. 

As for the look - it does do an amazing job of giving me a glowy, dewy, ‚Äújust-did-a-sheet-mask‚Äù look. The recommended two pumps is a bit too shiny for me, so I use one pump and I‚Äôm good. I have normal/dry skin. I did feel like it made some of my hyperpigmentation and scars look more prominent, but I was able to counteract that with a bit of concealer, which actually applied quite nicely over top of the Futuredew. Although it contains mica, I really don‚Äôt notice a shimmery/glittery appearance at all, it really just looks like a natural glow. 

In terms of the skincare benefits, it has a slight moisturizing effect, but nothing major that I‚Äôm not already getting from my routine. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen any significant change to my skin over the 6 weeks I‚Äôve been using it, other than the short-term glow. So I think the product description of ‚Äúoil serum hybrid‚Äù is a bit misleading. I would describe it more as an ‚Äúface oil-highlighter hybrid‚Äù. 

So overall, does it deliver? As an ‚Äúoil-serum hybrid‚Äù, not quite. But as a ‚Äúshortcut to the way your skin looks after a full skincare routine‚Äîdewy, glowing, cared-for‚Äù (another description from the Glossier website) - yes, it delivers. I think this is more of an issue with inconsistency in the way Glossier marketed this product than in the product itself. I think the product is good at what it does, which is giving that dewy look and making it last throughout the day. But don‚Äôt expect any significant lasting benefits. 

So will I continue to use this product? I will use up the bottle I have, but probably not repurchase. I just don‚Äôt see this product as a necessary part of my routine. If I want glowy skin, I‚Äôm more likely to reach for a classic highlighter like Glossier‚Äôs haloscope, and if I want a moisturizing oil, I‚Äôm more likely to reach for TO‚Äôs Rosehip oil. I‚Äôm just not reaching for Futuredew as much as I‚Äôd like to.

8vnnye,[Review] Glossier skincare/masks review + empties ‚ú®,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"A bit about me and my skin: Late 20s, dry due to my Mirena IUD and hypothyroidism, mild rosacea (self-diagnosed), and breakouts around my chin and jaw line. 

I tend to prefer calming and hydrating products. 

I‚Äôve tried a number of Glossier products because millennial, and finally have some empties and feel I can provide a review. 


###üëâ Rich Priming Moisturizer
This is the thicker one in the tub. Nice texture and smell, but I didn‚Äôt feel anything was super great about it. It didn‚Äôt make my skin softer or anything than other PM or thicker moisturizers, so I‚Äôve moved on to trying other products. 

Repurchase? Nah. 



###üëâ Balm dotcom (Rose and Birthday Cake)
I like the smells of these, tubes, texture, etc. There‚Äôs not much that makes these better than using vaseline, except the packaging is more convenient. I initially used this before bed but I noticed a strange film on my lips in the morning. Now they love in my purse and at my desk to use throughout the day. 

Repurchase? Yes, if I am buying something else. I wouldn‚Äôt place an order just for these, as I could easily pick up a gloss or balm from the drug store. 

###üëâ Priming moisturizer
I‚Äôm torn on this one. It‚Äôs a really nice AM moisturizer and goes on great under my makeup. I‚Äôve been using it regularly on light and no makeup days (only because I have other primers and sunscreens). I happen to have another tub so I am going to continue using it for now. 

Repurchase? Yes, but will continue searching for more affordable options. 



###üëâ Milk Jelly Cleanser
I genuinely love this stuff. I‚Äôve gone through two bottles now and am already onto my third. It doesn‚Äôt remove my makeup, but I use a micellar cleanser before milk jelly cleanser to take off the makeup. It‚Äôs gentle, calming, and super moisturizing. I love the rosey scent and texture of this cleanser. It‚Äôs great after masks too, to restore moisturize. 

Sometimes the price makes me sad ($18 USD), so I am trying out an alternative to see if I can cheapen my skincare routine, but Milk Jelly Cleanser might be my HG cleanser and worth it. 

Repurchase? 100%



###üëâ Mask Duo: Mega Greens Galaxy & Moon Mask
Grouping these together as Glossier recommends using both. Eh. I tried to like these because I liked the brand and names of the masks but ultimately I didn‚Äôt notice much of a difference on my skin. I like to use masks to help with color, brightness, and breakouts and I didn‚Äôt find these masks helped with anything. I constantly was turning to my Origin charcoal masks and clay masks instead, and had to force myself to finish these. 

Repurchase? No. 



###üëâ Solution (not pictured)
I already used chemical exfoliants from TO and Paula‚Äôs Choice but picked this up anyway to try it out. I felt it could be convenient as it has multiple exfoliants, etc. I tried for several days but it caused breakouts (not purging), so I gave it to my husband. He finished it and seems to like it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Repurchase? No.

**Age:** 24

**Environment:** humid, frequent temperature changes

**Medication:** On the pill 

**First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (AM/PM)**

* 2 oz tube lasted 2 1/2 months 
* Two words: simple and effective. Big fan of FAB as a whole because their products are alcohol and fragrance free. After moving from a humid to a dry environment, I was in need of a thicker moisturizer to prevent flakes and soothe my angry skin. FAB gets the job done without breaking the bank. When the temperature drops, I am able to use this product in the AM and PM without feeling oily. Also love that the Ultra Repair Cream has various tube size options because I don't like tub packages.                                                               
* Cons: Too thick to wear bare face in the summer, I end up looking oily (especially on my forehead) halfway through the day. In the process of looking for a lighter AM moisturizer for when I don't wear makeup.     
* Repurchase: Yes

**DR JARTS Cicapair Tiger Grass Serum (AM)**

* Lasted 3 months with off and on usage
* One of the biggest perks is the dropper design. Instead of having to squeeze the product out, you just click the top to release. Application is easy and the serum feels nice and cool, a little product goes a long way. Not sure how effective it is though, redness will go away around my nose and cheeks after application but only for a limited amount of time. I was hoping the serum would help combat redness for when I go without makeup. Definitely not the answer to a quick fix. If I had an unlimited skincare budget, the Tiger Grass Serum would be a nice little luxury but for now I will not be repurchasing. 
* Cons: The price does not justify the minimal results I have seen. I have had more success taming redness by implementing an overall more soothing routine. 
* Repurchase: For now, no

**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster (AM/PM)**

* Lasted 1 1/2 months 
* Needed an extra hydration boost once I added exfoliation into  my routine. Soaks in nicely, especially when I layer with a facial spray. Would need at least 2 pumps to fully cover my face. Overall, I feel like the booster did not add anything remarkable to my routine. No negative reactions or breakouts, but my skin did not feel extra hydrated. Results were the same on days I used the booster versus days I forgot to. Still looking for a serum or oil to add before/with my final moisturizer.
* Cons: Went through the product quickly with minimal results. Not cost effective for me to use reguarly ($20 for 1 fl oz)
* Repurchase: No

**Pixi Hydrating Milky Mist (AM/PM/As Needed)**

* Lasted 4 months 
* My first facial spray! Honestly was a splurge Target purchase that happened to work out really well for my skin. I like to layer my hydrating products with it or use as an extra boost throughout the day.  I also use it as a setting spray to prevent the ""cracked foundation"" look that usually occurs with my dry skin + makeup. While I haven't tried other sprays/mists, from what I gathered it seems like most of them achieve the same results. The Milky Mist isn't a HG, but it helps with inflammation/dryness and I can easily purchase it.
* Cons: none
* Repurchase: Yes

**Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel (not pictured) (AM/PM)**

* Lasted 4 months - Would have run out sooner, but I tested other products in between
* One of my first purchases when I decided to completely overhaul my skincare routine (per recommendations from this sub). Before starting chemical exfoliation, I would use this moisturizer in the AM and PM. Switched to just AM when I introduced Good Genes because it wasn't heavy enough. Feels cool and the gel sinks in quickly, no leftover residue or pilling. I wish my dry skin worked well with gel moisturizers because I love the texture! Unfortunately, it just isn't hydrating enough and I had to add other products in order for my skin to not be flakey.
* Cons: Pricey per oz for a drugstore product and comes in a tub. Too thin for the winter and wasn't hydrating enough under makeup.
* Repurchase: No

**Glossier Milky Jelly (PM)**  


* Lasted about 5 months  

* This is actually my second bottle of Milky Jelly. Switched to this product after Cerave Hydrating cleanser wasn't quite cutting it for me. Does a great job as my second cleanser when I am wearing makeup (no need for an additional eye makeup remover). Can get away with a single cleanse on no makeup days. The scent is lovely and my skin does not feel stripped afterwards. 
* Cons: Need an additional cleanser (right now I am using an oil) if wearing makeup. 
* Repurchase: Yes

**Bliss Mighty Marshmallow Mask (PM)**  


* Lasted 1 month  

* Product is creamy and has a sweet scent (does not bother me). Easy to apply and has a whipped texture. Would use after cleansing 1-2 times a week. My skin felt softer washing off, but I did not notice any brightening. I used the mask more for hydration.
* Cons: No brightening or radiance

Before I knew anything about skincare it was fun trying all their different products and getting excited about the pretty box coming and all the matching little bottles and jars on my shelf. It was fun! After realizing which products worked for me and which didn‚Äôt, I started doing actual research. Switched to The Ordinary where I can just go buy a certain ingredient at a low price. Definitely not as fun, but cheap and effective.

That being said, I can‚Äôt stop using a few of their products- 

milky jelly cleanser - this smells great (rose) and feels like rubbing silk clouds on your face. It‚Äôs my guilty pleasure and I‚Äôm not giving it up. Yes it is scented, but it‚Äôs on my face for like a second and I‚Äôve never had a reaction. 

‚Äúsolution‚Äù- chemical exfoliant with BHA and AHA. This works amazing for me. It was actually the first product I ever used that gave me noticeable results. It completely changed my skin texture. That was probably due to the fact that I had never exfoliated before and ANY exfoliant would have made a difference. But, after about a year it is still working for me so if it ain‚Äôt broke...

bubble wrap- a hyaluronic acid plumper for under eyes and lips. I‚Äôm really only holding onto this because it‚Äôs lasted so damn long. When I‚Äôm out I‚Äôll probably try to find something similar for cheaper, but it really does plump and smooth so it was money well spent.

7sgo17,[Review] Glossier's Solution,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"What makes me really interested in this product is the inclusion of a PHA, Gluconolactone. This is ideal for sensitive skin, according to this source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15002656

That source goes on to say that PHA helps the skin's barrier function (I've also read it increases the skin's production of ceramides), and can be used along with stronger treatments--including microdermabrasion, chemical peels, tretinoin. PHA is tolerated among people with rosacea too. It's one of the most hydrating acids.

Honestly this 10% aha formula seems more gentle than a 10% glycolic acid formula because of the ingredient list.  I just wish I knew how much PHA was in this formula. Lactic acid is a pretty gentle aha too, and I suspect there is more lactic acid in this formula because it's so high on the ingredient list. 

I feel like people are quick to judge Glossier, but imho this formula looks pretty good, and may be well-tolerated by many different skin types.",makes really interested product inclusion pha gluconolactone ideal sensitive skin according source source goes say pha helps skin barrier function also read increases skin production ceramides used along stronger treatments including microdermabrasion chemical peels tretinoin pha tolerated among people rosacea one hydrating acids honestly aha formula seems gentle glycolic acid formula ingredient list wish knew much pha formula lactic acid pretty gentle aha suspect lactic acid formula high ingredient list feel like people quick judge glossier imho formula looks pretty good may well tolerated many different skin types

ic5wsh,[PSA] Glossier workers are organizing against the company's Anti-Blackness and corporate racism.,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"This isn‚Äôt an effort to ‚Äúargue‚Äù with the post above as much as it is some ~food for thought~. I‚Äôve seen a lot of company takedowns as of late quite similar to what‚Äôs happening with glossier. While I think the employees choosing to speak out are brave and attesting to much needed changes in retail/the service industry, I also worry these issues are being misframed, and causing progressives to cast their fury in the wrong direction.

The complaints glossier employees have detailed are disgusting and valid. They also acknowledge that most of their complaints are sadly a natural consequence of working a service role that involves face to face interface with customers. Glossier - and most retail brands - are absolutely at fault when they fail to intercept unpleasant or racist customer interactions, but I‚Äôm not sure I would call these issues ‚Äúsystemic racism‚Äù or even company-faulted microaggressions. Systemic racism speaks specifically to policies imparted by the company that directly and consistently harm POC employees, like disproportionately not promoting them, etc. With the exception of the managers who apparently received no recourse for using incorrect pronouns/confusing POC employees (gross), I‚Äôm not sure any of these complaints really fall under the category of systemic company racism/sexism/etc. In reality I think this speaks to a much broader problem that is pervasive in the service industry in the US especially, which is a vehement capitalist attitude toward ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction‚Äù that will ALWAYS value customer experience over low-level employee welfare. This also typically extends beyond racism/sexism - in the food industry as a service worker I was constantly barraged with abuse from customers who would almost always receive free food as compensation for their ‚Äúgrievances‚Äù. It sucked. It‚Äôs a major problem. It exists in other countries as well, but in my experience living abroad, managers tend to push back a bit more. In the US? Never. The customer is always right. 

Glossier has positioned itself as an ethical brand, which is why it‚Äôs now come under such fire for failing to meet customer/employee standards that it realistically never could. Are they more inclusive than other brands? Absolutely. But does that render them inherently ethical in the sense that they‚Äôll prioritize ~seemingly minor~ employee complaints over making money? Of course not! Glossier is a brand and a capitalist institution. I‚Äôm saying this as someone who‚Äôs used their products but isn‚Äôt a particularly huge fan (I wouldn‚Äôt go to them for skincare stuff tbh): can we genuinely argue that other skincare brands are doing better? Do we know ANYTHING about the employee practices of brands like La Mer or Sunday Riley or anyone else? Not really. Glossier‚Äôs self-positioning as a supposedly ethical brand has forced it to be more transparent than most. It‚Äôs worth casting blame where blame is due and demanding action - this is a good thing! And I commend glossier employees. But before you all burn your milky jelly cleanser and denounce the company I compel you to question whether you feel confident assuming another brand behaves better. I sadly doubt it, and feel we ought to consider who should be rewarded and punished  throughout this takedown process.",effort argue post much food thought seen lot company takedowns late quite similar happening glossier think employees choosing speak brave attesting much needed changes retail service industry also worry issues misframed causing progressives cast fury wrong direction complaints glossier employees detailed disgusting valid also acknowledge complaints sadly natural consequence working service role involves face face interface customers glossier retail brands absolutely fault fail intercept unpleasant racist customer interactions sure would call issues systemic racism even company faulted microaggressions systemic racism speaks specifically policies imparted company directly consistently harm poc employees like disproportionately promoting etc exception managers apparently received recourse using incorrect pronouns confusing poc employees gross sure complaints really fall category systemic company racism sexism etc reality think speaks much broader problem pervasive service industry us especially vehement capitalist attitude toward customer satisfaction always value customer experience low level employee welfare also typically extends beyond racism sexism food industry service worker constantly barraged abuse customers would almost always receive free food compensation grievances sucked major problem exists countries well experience living abroad managers tend push back bit us never customer always right glossier positioned ethical brand come fire failing meet customer employee standards realistically never could inclusive brands absolutely render inherently ethical sense prioritize seemingly minor employee complaints making money course glossier brand capitalist institution saying someone used products particularly huge fan go skincare stuff tbh genuinely argue skincare brands better know anything employee practices brands like la mer sunday riley anyone else really glossier self positioning supposedly ethical brand forced transparent worth casting blame blame due demanding action good thing commend glossier employees burn milky jelly cleanser denounce company compel question whether feel confident assuming another brand behaves better sadly doubt feel ought consider rewarded punished throughout takedown process

 *Glossier Solution*:  This is a chemical exfoliant that I have been using for a couple of weeks now.  It's both an AHA and a BHA exfoliant.  If you have mildly sensitive skin with redness (like me!) I recommend using it maybe twice a week.  I used it two days in a row at first and literally had little gobs of old skin flaking off of my face, which is just a little too harsh for me. 






*Glossier Boy Brow*:  I have eyebrows that stop playing by any rules about halfway through my brow.  The ends of my brows are virtually non-existent, so I can't use this product on its own.  Its an amazing brow gel though! I use it mainly on the inner part of my brow to accentuate where my hair actually wants to show up.





*Glossier Bom Dot Com (Coconut)*: UGH LOVELOVELOVE. I refuse to put this in my purse because the second I do I know I'm going to lose it to the lip product gods. The smell is dead on real coconut (doesn't smell like the fake coconut scent, you know what I'm talking about) and it stays on my lips FOR HOURS.  I will also use this on my cuticles to try to curb my nasty habit I have at picking away mercilessly at them. 





*Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser*:  Super moisturizing cleanser.  Great for sensitive skin.  I use this after I use a cleansing oil and it's gentle enough that it doesn't feel like it strips the work the oil did before.






*Glossier Cloud Paints (Dusk and Puff)*: Maybe my favorite product so far!! It blends so well into your skin that even if you feel like you have used too much, you can just keep blending and you won't feel like a total failure. I highly recommend both of these colors as they feel universal. 






*Glossier Haloscope (Moonstone)*:  Love this for a wet look.  I pair it with the skin tint and it gives me a ""Damn is that girl 24 or 12?!"" look.  I can sadly only wear this on days when I feel like wearing almost nothing. I doesn‚Äôt give off much of a actual highlight and I feel like the effect tends to fade fast. 






*Glossier Skin Tint (Medium)*: OMG FINALLY A DEWY SHEER COVERAGE FORMULA THAT DOESN'T BREAK UP!!  I have been searching for this all my life I feel.  When I put it on it makes me look like a dewy little baby.  There is virtually no coverage, so be prepared for that, but that's the look I love! I want my few freckles to shine.  I'm okay with the limited shade range, since it is so sheer, one color can virtually adapt to several different skin tones and shades.



Well this was my first post and I hope I was able to put out some honest and simple reviews accompanied by a pretty little picture (the light in my bathroom is quite amazing).  Let me know your thoughts or if you have any questions!

Thanks for getting in touch‚Äîmy apologies for any concern. I can confirm that the Solution formula is still active, effective, and completely safe to use. There may be natural variances from batch to batch (and bottle to bottle), due to the naturally-derived materials in the formula, resulting in the suspended strains that you‚Äôre seeing in your Solution.

Have a great day,

I had wanted to try this for a while due to their alluring advertising. This highlighter is pretty great for a subtle sheen, but it's pretty sheer. When you get it right, though, it's very pretty and natural looking, especially on drier skin. I've found that the best way to apply it is swiping it across the tip of my index finger and patting it along my cheekbone. The pigment is better when you apply the product directly, but it's hard to apply over base makeup and I only ever do that when I'm not wearing anything underneath. I've never been disappointed by this product for what it is. Would most likely repurchase, though I doubt I will ever run out.

3) **Boy brow**

I got this in a package along with the haloscope and didn't really plan to use it. I have pretty full and naturally shaped and neat brows and have never used eyebrow products. However, this one really surprised me. It's super easy to use and is VERY PIGMENTED. When I apply just a tiny bit to one of my eyebrows, it adds a good amount of depth and shape. I love using this product and will definitely repurchase.

4) **Milky jelly cleanser**

I love this cleanser. It's a lot of fun to use and it smells great. However, the price per ounce is too much for me to reasonably consider repurchasing and I really only use this cleanser on occasion because I don't want it to run out. You really only need ~half of a pump for your whole face, and it seems to work pretty well. I definitely recommend trying it, but I find that the price point really weighs down the allure of this product.

5) **Cloud Paint in Beam and Dusk**

These are amazingly easy to apply, and look good as a blush on the cheeks or as a splash of color on the eyelids. The major thing with these is that a little goes a LONG WAY and it is very easy to accidentally apply too much. Start low and go slow. Blended out, these look very subtle and add a bit of warmth and brightness to your face. They look very natural. Dusk is very warm, and if you're not careful it can almost look like a bronzer. Beam is a beautiful coral color that blends into a very subtle pinky glow on the cheeks.

7x6swh,[PSA] Glossier Referral Code Thread - February 13th 2018 to August 12th 2019,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,"Thank you if you chose to use my code! :) http://bff.glossier.com/hxECf

Here's my 2 cents:

**-Hx:**Recently changing careers and need to super simplify my make up routine and improve my skin care. In the past my skin would always get dewey a few hours after I put on make up and I liked it. Now my skin is starting to feel drier, make up looks duller, and I'm breaking out more. Trying to bring back the dewey goodness.

-Customer service is excellent.

**-Birthday Balm Dot Com:** Holy smokes I LOVE IT. I am a serious lover of vanilla lip balms; POGO My Party and Chapstick Cake Batter are also two I love. Birthday BDC smells fantastic, is not as thick/goopy as POGO and more emollient than the Chapstick brand. Also, the teeniest, tiniest bit covers my lips completely -- was sad the package was a bit small, but I can see now it's going to last. Put Melt OnTheGo over the top and it made it into a sheer version. Sweetness.
Also tried the cherry flavor. It gets a big meh from me. Still their nice balm and it did have a slight red tint (why I tried it), but I didn‚Äôt love the cherry smell as much as I do vanilla. It was more medicinal than candy-like for me.

**-MilkyJelly Cleanser:** Has a very nice feel to it, cleansed well. Very comparable to my CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser in texture and cleansing ability, but MilkyJelly is slightly more drying. Also, it actually did work pretty well to remove my makeup, but I still like to use an oil for double cleanse--so I‚Äôll save it for the 2nd cleanse.  This has since become my favorite cleanser.  It works so well, feels gentle, and the smell is what does me in -- I look forward to it every night.

**-Moisturizing Primer:** I had really high hopes for this as I'm looking for something dewier than my CeraVePM that won't cause a breakout. It's definitely more dewey than my CVPM and it leaves a glossy sheen, but I still felt like I needed to put a couple drops of maracuja oil on after putting on make up (Bareminerals Complexion Rescue hydrating tinted gel). IDK, my skin is a desert now. Overall, I like the dewey finish and will continue to use this.  It's somewhat similar to Embryolysse.

**-Cloud Paints:** Powder blushes were starting to look cakey on me -- so these are exactly what i was hoping they would be. Very, very easy to use. Totally doofus-proof. Smooth finish. No powdery, dryness that sits on top of my skin. Dusk and Beam together look like a nice little tan and fresh sun. Really love these. I also use Benetints, which I still really like, but cloud paints are even easier as I didn't get any darker spots from not moving fast enough.

**Haloscope:** In Quartz. I really like this. It has a really natural looking shine. Honestly, IMO it could be more moisturizing and dewey, but like I said I think my skin might be turning into the Sahara, so maybe that's just me. When people joked that Glossier is just vaseline in different colors, I was sittin' here like ""sweet, pls come thru for me."" It's somewhat more moisturizing and definitely less powdery than Watts Up in a stick (not the one with the clear center-i've never tried that one) and all my powders. Pretty similar to High Beam, but goes on a little easier/more subtle/natural. Probably would like to get the other colors. *Have since ordered the other colors and they‚Äôre really great. The look of these is just enough sparkle and natural, dewey shine for me. Topaz for when I feel I need little color/sun and moonstone for a low key night out.  I think Topaz is my favorite, it looks like a natural, glow-y tan. 

**-Mask Duo:** The Greens Mask is true to it‚Äôs word as a very gentle cleansing mask. I felt clean and refreshed and not tight and dry after. Followed it with the Moon Mask and it does make you feel like a day at the spa. It‚Äôs cool and refreshing. It‚Äôs like the equivalent of chugging a pedialyte when you‚Äôre parched...but for your face. Not goopy, oily, or greasy. My skin felt super soft. I‚Äôm sure there may be ones of equal or better quality out there... but I like these.

**-You fragrance:** got a sample of this and it‚Äôs quiet lovely. Warm and comforting, clean and yet somewhat familiar.  Have since got this a birthday gift to myself.  I love it and I get compliments when I wear it, but it seems to diminish pretty quickly on my skin (like 2-3hrs tops of wear time). :(",thank chose use code cents hx recently changing careers need super simplify make routine improve skin care past skin would always get dewey hours put make liked skin starting feel drier make looks duller breaking trying bring back dewey goodness customer service excellent birthday balm dot com holy smokes love serious lover vanilla lip balms pogo party chapstick cake batter also two love birthday bdc smells fantastic thick goopy pogo emollient chapstick brand also teeniest tiniest bit covers lips completely sad package bit small see going last put melt onthego top made sheer version sweetness also tried cherry flavor gets big meh still nice balm slight red tint tried love cherry smell much vanilla medicinal candy like milkyjelly cleanser nice feel cleansed well comparable cerave moisturizing cleanser texture cleansing ability milkyjelly slightly drying also actually work pretty well remove makeup still like use oil double cleanse save nd cleanse since become favorite cleanser works well feels gentle smell look forward every night moisturizing primer really high hopes looking something dewier ceravepm cause breakout definitely dewey cvpm leaves glossy sheen still felt like needed put couple drops maracuja oil putting make bareminerals complexion rescue hydrating tinted gel idk skin desert overall like dewey finish continue use somewhat similar embryolysse cloud paints powder blushes starting look cakey exactly hoping would easy use totally doofus proof smooth finish powdery dryness sits top skin dusk beam together look like nice little tan fresh sun really love also use benetints still really like cloud paints even easier get darker spots moving fast enough haloscope quartz really like really natural looking shine honestly imo could moisturizing dewey like said think skin might turning sahara maybe people joked glossier vaseline different colors sittin like sweet pls come thru somewhat moisturizing definitely less powdery watts stick one clear center never tried one powders pretty similar high beam goes little easier subtle natural probably would like get colors since ordered colors really great look enough sparkle natural dewey shine topaz feel need little color sun moonstone low key night think topaz favorite looks like natural glow tan mask duo greens mask true word gentle cleansing mask felt clean refreshed tight dry followed moon mask make feel like day spa cool refreshing like equivalent chugging pedialyte parched face goopy oily greasy skin felt super soft sure may ones equal better quality like fragrance got sample quiet lovely warm comforting clean yet somewhat familiar since got birthday gift love get compliments wear seems diminish pretty quickly skin like hrs tops wear time

My favorite products are:

* **Stretch Concealer**: Thin, creamy concealer. This won't completely cover dark circles, but definitely helps camouflage them while still giving a natural look. Also good for concealing redness around nose, etc.
* **Boy Brow**: This product is great, but the packaging kind of isn't. If you can get past the brush pulling out way too much product, it's overall the best brow product I've tried. (I'd steer clear of the Clear option if you have dark brows because it doesn't dry completely clear.)
* **Cloud Paint**: Creamy consistency, subdued colors that can be built up, and very easy to use.",favorite products stretch concealer thin creamy concealer completely cover dark circles definitely helps camouflage still giving natural look also good concealing redness around nose etc boy brow product great packaging kind get past brush pulling way much product overall best brow product tried steer clear clear option dark brows dry completely clear cloud paint creamy consistency subdued colors built easy use

Spoiler alert: Im disappointed

My lipps: dry and chapped of not taking care even bleeding

I drink a lot of water.

Packaging: its a little reddish pink tube. It feels and looks not cheap. I love the color.

Description: in real life its a more light rosa cream texture. Its a little shiny and smells amazingly after berries. The best thing about it its the smell. Its almost like bubblegum.

Application experience: as I said the smell is the best part of it. I literally could eat it like candy. It even tastes a little sweet too (in my experience). After application it kinda looks like a lipgloss. The lipps look pretty hydrated, for the next five minutes.

After five minutes: my lipps are dried out, even more than before application. There is no way this is a night treatment. This even cant be a daily chapstick treatment.

I switched to vaseline again, I love vaseline so much and its so cheap. Laneige isnt cheap and it doesnt even give the same benefits to me like vaseline does.

Maybe: the lipbalm is maybe good over a good hydrating chapstick, to seal in the moisture, but on its own its not what I need.",review laneige lip sleeping mask ex berry spoiler alert im disappointed lipps dry chapped taking care even bleeding drink lot water packaging little reddish pink tube feels looks cheap love color description real life light rosa cream texture little shiny smells amazingly berries best thing smell almost like bubblegum application experience said smell best part literally could eat like candy even tastes little sweet experience application kinda looks like lipgloss lipps look pretty hydrated next five minutes five minutes lipps dried even application way night treatment even cant daily chapstick treatment switched vaseline love vaseline much cheap laneige isnt cheap doesnt even give benefits like vaseline maybe lipbalm maybe good good hydrating chapstick seal moisture need

op8dv1,[REVIEW] Laneige Cream Skin Refiner Mist and Pad - Oily/Combo Skin Review,Laneige,SkincareAddiction,"***I've compiled a list with links to all of my skincare reviews into a reddit post that is easily searchable and sorted by product type*** [***HERE***](https://www.reddit.com/user/the_medusa_edit/comments/ost0q7/megathread_all_reviews_by_skincare_category/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3])

*I purchased all of the products myself and was in no way sponsored.*

***Skin-Type:*** *Combination/oily, South Asian, Fitzpatrick III/IV, acne prone only under facial hair*

***Skin Concerns***: Anti-ageing and some anti-acne requirements

**LANEIGE CREAM SKIN REFINER, MIST & QUICK SKIN PACK**

I‚Äôm putting the Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, Mist and Pads together for this review because they are really the same product, just in different formats.

***Packaging***: All three of the products have this sleek thick plastic packaging that I think looks very beautiful on a vanity or bathroom shelf. I‚Äôve never had a problem with any leaking from any of the products and the mist, which is my favourite, has a really nice fine spray, that has a good cooling effect (just perfect for the warmer months). I also think this is the perfect way to use the product if, like me, you have oily/combo skin, to get a good amount of nourishment without any oiliness.

***Product Feel and Smell***: I think this product became well known for its really unique texture change effect, which that is most easily felt using the refiner itself. As you put it onto your hands it‚Äôs a thin milky liquid, but the magic happens when you apply it to your face. Almost instantly the watery milk somehow melts into your skin and provides this instant burst of nourishing moisturization. It feels as if you‚Äôve used a really good moisturiser without the heaviness. I find myself reaching for the pads whenever I have inflamed or angry skin, as a quick mask pack, and I use the mist throughout warmer months if my moisture barrier is compromised. I haven‚Äôt ever noticed any smell or fragrance, though the mist did end up in my mouth once and was surprisingly sweet!

***Does It Work?*** For me this has been a Holy Grail product that has helped recover my skin when it‚Äôs been really inflamed or the moisture barrier has been completely ruined by over exfoliation or use of retinoids. I‚Äôm super happy to have discovered the mist version because I loved using the refiner but it was a bit too much for my oily/combo skin, so was kept for night time use. The mist gives the same wonderful benefit to my skin, without the shine, meaning I can quickly use it in the morning and get all of the benefits without having to worry about shiny face.

***Positives***: Lovely packaging, deep nourishment, works well with all my other products.

***Negatives:*** Not much! Across the 3 formats, think is a universal product

***Overall Opinion:*** This is a very trusty go to for me, whenever my skin really needs some care. I think the mist is HG status for me now, though I did love the bottled refiner itself too before I tried the mist. As you can see, I have a back-up bottle ready, and don‚Äôt see this leaving my armoury anytime soon!",compiled list links skincare reviews reddit post easily searchable sorted product type purchased products way sponsored skin type combination oily south asian fitzpatrick iii iv acne prone facial hair skin concerns anti ageing anti acne requirements laneige cream skin refiner mist quick skin pack putting laneige cream skin refiner mist pads together review really product different formats packaging three products sleek thick plastic packaging think looks beautiful vanity bathroom shelf never problem leaking products mist favourite really nice fine spray good cooling effect perfect warmer months also think perfect way use product like oily combo skin get good amount nourishment without oiliness product feel smell think product became well known really unique texture change effect easily felt using refiner put onto hands thin milky liquid magic happens apply face almost instantly watery milk somehow melts skin provides instant burst nourishing moisturization feels used really good moisturiser without heaviness find reaching pads whenever inflamed angry skin quick mask pack use mist throughout warmer months moisture barrier compromised ever noticed smell fragrance though mist end mouth surprisingly sweet work holy grail product helped recover skin really inflamed moisture barrier completely ruined exfoliation use retinoids super happy discovered mist version loved using refiner bit much oily combo skin kept night time use mist gives wonderful benefit skin without shine meaning quickly use morning get benefits without worry shiny face positives lovely packaging deep nourishment works well products negatives much across formats think universal product overall opinion trusty go whenever skin really needs care think mist hg status though love bottled refiner tried mist see back bottle ready see leaving armoury anytime soon

135ysuo,[b&a] eczema before and after using Laneige lip mask,Laneige,SkincareAddiction,"If anyone wanted more informations on my journey:

STRAP IT, ITS GONNA BE A LONG ONE

Ive been licking my lips ever since i could remember. I always needed to have some lip balm with me or i would lick them until they became cracked and scaly. 

When i was younger, i would use any lip balm i could find but mostly the La Roche Posay Cicaplast lip balm.

In highschool, i would use EOS round lip balms or random lip smackers.

At that point, i didnt think it was a medical condition, i just thought putting lip balm on was an OCD. 

People would tell me ""stop that, you're putting on too much"" ""stop, you look dumb"" and other stuff like that which made me really mad because i couldnt stop.

In late 2021, my lips started to really act up because i was under a lot of stress and i literally tried every lip balm i could find.

My usual lip balms would hurt me so i used Vaseline but then, i learned it could be eczema so i started buying Eurecin Aquaphor lip balm because it was for eczema (sort of) but it got even worst so i stopped using it cause i could be allergic to an ingredient in it so i went back to Vaseline 

At this point, i couldn't talk much or kiss my boyfriend because it hurt so much and i wouldn't go outside without a mask because i was so ashamed of myself.

Then at some point, i ran out of Vaseline and couldn't go buy some new but i remembered i had received a mini laneige sample kit as my birthday present and i tried the lip mask and let me tell you, the smell was AMAZING!!!.

I cant believe i didn't try it on right away when i got it because that shit solved every problems i have. 

I have a big issue with lip balm in sticks because i really need to lather that shit heavy on my lips and this lip balm was perfect. Just one swoop of it and its weighty enough to feel right on my lips. My flare disappeared a few weeks after using it.

Since that moment, I haven't stopped using it and I haven't had a flare up.

I use around 2 of these lip balms every month and they might be quite pricey (from Sephora online, around 34$ tax included) i think they are worth it.

TLDR: Just try it once, its amazing.",anyone wanted informations journey strap gon na long one ive licking lips ever since could remember always needed lip balm would lick became cracked scaly younger would use lip balm could find mostly la roche posay cicaplast lip balm highschool would use eos round lip balms random lip smackers point didnt think medical condition thought putting lip balm ocd people would tell stop putting much stop look dumb stuff like made really mad couldnt stop late lips started really act lot stress literally tried every lip balm could find usual lip balms would hurt used vaseline learned could eczema started buying eurecin aquaphor lip balm eczema sort got even worst stopped using cause could allergic ingredient went back vaseline point talk much kiss boyfriend hurt much go outside without mask ashamed point ran vaseline go buy new remembered received mini laneige sample kit birthday present tried lip mask let tell smell amazing cant believe try right away got shit solved every problems big issue lip balm sticks really need lather shit heavy lips lip balm perfect one swoop weighty enough feel right lips flare disappeared weeks using since moment stopped using flare use around lip balms every month might quite pricey sephora online around tax included think worth tldr try amazing

uwhi4i,[Haul] [Review] Annual haul of Sulwhasoo products. Been a while since I made the switch to an almost exclusively Sulwhasoo skincare routine and haven‚Äôt looked back since. Full routine + short review of the must-haves in the comments.,Sulwhasoo,SkincareAddiction,"My skin type is combination with occasional breakouts if I neglect skincare for more than a week. Got into skincare wanting to preserve my (24F) youngish complexion and reduce stress breakouts (glass skin is also a plus). So far, Sulwhasoo is always reliable for me and has shown the most noticeable effects- even on first use. Even when I ignore skincare for a week or so because of med school stress, one night‚Äôs routine is enough to get my complexion glowing again, so suffice to say I‚Äôm really a huge fanatic for this brand. 

I know a lot of people find the Sulwhasoo lineup overwhelming, but what I can attest is that it‚Äôs done WONDERS for my skin. Honestly I got into Sulwhasoo because it was dubbed as ‚ÄúTHE luxury Korean skincare brand‚Äù, but it really does work as advertised for me!! Of course there are some that stand out more than the others. So, ask me anything about the products or how to use them. If you want reviews on other products I didnt expound on, please tell me too and I‚Äôd be happy to share! 


Additional information: My full daily routine is composed of these Sulwhasoo products (in order) (I‚Äôve repurchased everything also) 

- Gentle Cleansing Foam
- Purifying Herbal Clay Purifying Mask (every other day) 
- First Care Activating Serum
- Essential/Essential Comfort Water and Emulsion
- Ginseng Water and Emulsion
- Ginseng Serum
- Firming cream
- Moisturizing cream
- Ginseng eye cream
- Ginseng Moisturizing cream
- Overnight Vitalizing mask
- Snowise cushion
- Loose powder
- Essential and Ginseng sheet masks

In addition to these Sulwhasoo products, sometimes I insert the Estee Lauder eye serum and Elizabeth Arden Retinol to my routine as needed. 

Special mentions/Short review of the best products:
- First Care Activating Serum
If you‚Äôre thinking of buying only one Sulwhasoo product, GET THIS ONE. I cannot emphasize how big of an impact this lone product has on my whole routine. It was the first Sulwhasoo product I‚Äôve bought and applying it before everything in my routine really showed increase effects of everything I apply on my face - moisturizers make my skin softer than usual, serums brighten more etc. LoTs of people are spooked because it contains alcohol, but I‚Äôve personally never felt the negatives of it. Applies watery and dries fast, giving you only a short wait time before you can apply the rest of your routine after. HOLY GRAIL product imho. 

Essential Water and Emulsion:
This alone can make for 1/2 of a whole routine if you‚Äôre pressed for time. In the mornings where I have to rush, I can ignore every other step in my routine except for these two, and my skin will still stay dewy and fresh even in the afternoon. Water is like a toner which is nice, and the emulsion applies thin, but still gives a nice soft moisturizing feel. Plus, if you follow the way the website teaches you how to apply it, the whole experience feels like a spa and really helps relax the nerves. 

Ginseng serum: 
Although this was hailed as one of the best products in the brand, I don‚Äôt really see that much effect on my skin? I was told that it was because it was meant for older skin, but nonetheless I do see effects in minimizing fine lines and giving an overall nutritive feel. Probably not advisable for those who aren‚Äôt used to Asian/herbal products though, since it has a very strong ginseng smell. Personally, I find the smell cathartic because it smells like old-timey skincare products my mother used to have, but to each their own. 

Purifying Herbal Clay Mask: THIS. SAVES. MY. SKIN. when I neglect skincare for a few days and everything feels rough and bumpy, I apply this and leave it on for 2-5 minutes. It makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. Easily one of the products that I run out of the most. It may be a clay mask, but I don‚Äôt think its comparable to other similar masks because it doesn‚Äôt really dry out my skin as much, and gives a very purifying feel to it too.

v6dfcg,[product question] is the brand Sulwhasoo really worth the price and hype?,Sulwhasoo,SkincareAddiction,"I can‚Äôt speak to Sulwhasoo specifically, but I mostly use luxury products and have used everything from The Ordinary to all the asian beauty to La Mer, so I think my insight may be helpful. 

You can get great products at a very affordable price point, but often where those products lack is in ‚Äúcosmetic elegance,‚Äù which is whether a product has a nice texture/consistency/smell/etc, and also in packaging, since a lot of pricier products come in really good quality packaging that feels and looks fancy whereas cheaper products‚Äô packaging can feel/look underwhelming. Personally, spending more to get more cosmetically elegant products with fancier packaging is worth it. Tons of other people think it isn‚Äôt. Both are valid! 

To answer your question‚Ä¶ Well, that depends on a lot of factors and it‚Äôs very individual. 

Short answer: 

Maybe. You‚Äôd need to try it to know if it‚Äôs worth it for YOU because what‚Äôs worth it for you and someone else will not be the same. The only person who can decide if it‚Äôs worth it is you!

Long answer: 

My perspective is that skincare is my ‚Äúhappy place.‚Äù I love it, it brings me joy, using fancy products makes me excited for my routine, and I‚Äôm lucky to be in a good spot financially where spending a lot on skincare doesn‚Äôt cause me harm (however, I did prioritize spending on skincare even before I was doing super well financially because it made me feel good). To me, spending 100$+ on a HA/hydrating serum is worth it even if I can get something very similar for 10$ because it makes me happy and motivates me to do my routine, and I find it far more pleasant to use. I have ADHD so I need to get dopamine from something in order to be able to do it with ease, and making my skincare routine luxurious/exciting is one of those ways and therefore I stay consistent with it. Would I say that serum is worth it to me? 100% yes. Would I say it‚Äôs worth it for someone else? Not necessarily, and not at all if that person is on a tight budget. 

So, something being worth it really just boils down to whether it‚Äôs worth it for *you* based on *your individual needs and desires.* 

Skincare is also incredibly subjective! What works miracles for me could break you out like crazy and vice versa, so even my HGs that I believe are 100% worth the money may be totally not worth it for you. IMO, this is where most people hardcore f*ck up with skincare‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really important to remember how individual skin is and to never expect any product to perform miracles, regardless of the price tag. A product can only do so much whether it‚Äôs 10$ or 1000$.

I have seen more progress in my skin with a very expensive routine than I did when doing a similar routine with very inexpensive products. However, it could be the opposite for someone else.

2. Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum (recent)
3. Cosrx AHA/BHA Toner
4. TO Azelaic Acid
5. TO HA Moisturizer
6. Either Shiseido SPF or Centella Green Level Unscented SPF

Evening 
1. Wash face with Alpyn Beauty PlantGenius Creamy Cleanser
2. Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum (recent)
3. TO AHA/BHA mask once a week
4. Cosrx AHA/BHA Toner
5. Alternate between either Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid and Cosrx AHA Whitehead Power Liquid
6. Sulwhasoo Timetreasure Serum (recent)
7. Mizon Snail Repair Eye Cream (recent)
8. Cosrx Honey Overnight Mask as moisturizer (recent)

TOP 3 game changers for me:

1. Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum - this is a LUXURY product... very expensive. I bought a 20 pack sampler from eBay because I wanted to see if the hype was worth it. It‚Äôs probably one of the better known products of this brand. And honestly it‚Äôs been two week since I‚Äôve started using it and I feel like it‚Äôs what gives me a glow because it helps my face retain more moisture. I was complaining about dull skin before but this has made a noticeable difference. You are supposed to use it after you wash your face and before all other products. It claims to help ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the rest of your routine. I honestly will most likely purchase the full size after I finish all the packets. I started using the Sulwhasoo Timetreasure serum as part of breaking into anti-aging. This may also be what is contributing to the glow. I can‚Äôt say for sure though since I started both at the same time. However I think the first care serum does more because I use it day and night and can see the same effects during the day. 
2. Cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid - this stuff works WONDERS for me when I feel a breakout coming. I put it on the problem area (red bump appearing or those sore spots when you know a pimple is coming up) and it clears overnight. I feel like it also helps clear out existing breakouts faster too.  I don‚Äôt use it everyday as I found it was not effective for me. But usually 2-3 times a week at night. Beware it does smell like fish lol but I‚Äôll take it. This is my second bottle. Honorable mention to the TO AHA/BHA mask that I use once a week. It has a similar effect. 
3. TO Azelaic acid - I feel like this has kept a lot of acne at bay. It also has really reduced the perpetual redness in my cheeks. My husband uses this as well and he used to have deep acne scars on his cheeks; they have since faded noticeably. He also uses this on current acne problem areas and feels like they have been clearing faster. 
4. Also honorable mention to Cosrx honey overnight mask. It has a gel texture which surprised me at first. Boy, it makes my dry cheeks not flakey and my skin is so smooth in the morning. It‚Äôs been a long time since I did not have flakes and I don‚Äôt wake up with an overly oily face either. I‚Äôve only been using it for a week or so but it helps noticeably over just using TO moisturizer at night. 

3 things that don‚Äôt do good but don‚Äôt do harm. Meh:

1. Alpyn Beauty Cleaner
2. Cosrx AHA/BHA Toner (on my third bottle just because all toners to me feel meh so I stuck with it)
3. Cosrx Hyaluronic Acid (im most likely going to remove this completely from my routine once done with the bottle)

**The essence:** It's moisturizing but not too thick. Absorbs nicely. I don't much care for the smell. The best thing about this essence is that it makes my skin softer than anything else (except maybe the Clinique Moisture Surge 100 hr...). I have used it for 3-4 months now.  The essence comes in a nice bottle with a pump.  Might repurchase.

**The Cream:** It's very moisturizing and calming at the same time. Loved it. The ""ampoule"" in the name made me think it would be heavy but it's not. It does sit on top of my skin a bit.  The trial size only contains about 7 ml of product so I will use the rest for my eye area. My under-eye areas aren't doing very well these days.  Bought it last week so too soon to comment on its effects other than how it felt. I will go for the full size tub when I need a new night time moisturizer.  Oh and it contains light fragrance.",product names really mouthful days anyhoo normal dry skin essence moisturizing thick absorbs nicely much care smell best thing essence makes skin softer anything else except maybe clinique moisture surge hr used months essence comes nice bottle pump might repurchase cream moisturizing calming time loved ampoule name made think would heavy sit top skin bit trial size contains ml product use rest eye area eye areas well days bought last week soon comment effects felt go full size tub need new night time moisturizer oh contains light fragrance

9l1519,[Product Question] innisfree,Innisfree,SkincareAddiction,"I've tried the Green Tea Balancing lotion and the Green Tea Seed Serum.

The balancing line is geared for those with Combination skin types. It was a thin moisturizer that I really liked for the warmer months. Unfortunately they've reformulated it and it now causes CCs for me. Check CosDNA for the ingredient comparison, since YMMV. I have pretty sensitive/reactive skin. The lotion was also very fragarent. It didn't smell like green tea, more like men's cologne. Pretty overpowering, so those with scent sensitivities would probably not like it.

The serum was ok, but nothing spectacular to me. Consistency was nice and absorbed well. It just wasn't enough for the harsh winter climate of the Northeast for me. No breakouts tho, so that was a plus!

I would def recommend checking out r/AsianBeauty and their megathreads so you can see what others like/recommend from Innisfree (their orchid eye cream is super popular)

isthsq,[Review] Innisfree Dewy Glow Jelly Cream with Jeju Cherry Blossom üå∏,Innisfree,SkincareAddiction,"Came in a multicolored speckled gray box and the product has a similar top to box with a slighly transparent pink outer and and white inside that contains the clear jelly ‚Äúcream‚Äù. Has a light fragrance of cherry blossoms but smells similar to baby oil/powder. Layered on my face well with my other non-jelly products. I didn‚Äôt see a dewy glow in the day, because I always did a routine with SPF, but at night I see the glow. As it is a jelly it absorbs well into the skin. Didn‚Äôt leave a film or heavy feeling on my face. The moisture lasted me around 4hrs without a ‚Äúdried-out‚Äù feeling but after the 4hrs my face was a comfortable ‚Äúdry‚Äù. Due to the jelly absorbing so well, I am now open to trying other jelly/gel products. Would I buy again? Yes but it only last a month if you use both day and night as its only 1.69fl oz/50mL.

isthsq,[Review] Innisfree Dewy Glow Jelly Cream with Jeju Cherry Blossom üå∏,Innisfree,SkincareAddiction,"I adore this cream! In general I really like Innisfree more than I feel others do? I dunno, but they haven't done me wrong yet. It is fragranced as most of their products are, and I know that's technically bad? But I've honestly never had an issue, my skin reacts to everything but not to their products, and the particular scent on the Jeju Cherry Blossom products I actually find quite lovely.

I am a sucker for gel creams - I have dry skin so this might seem paradoxical, but they really are the best for my skin in the summer time since I layer an additional sunscreen moisturizer on top anyway. They just provide direct quenching hydration my skin drinks up, and I love the bouncy supple finish. I've really loved the Belif Aqua Bomb, Garnier SkinActive gel moisturizer, and Etude House Moistfull Collagen Water Jelly Cream in the past. I think the Dewy Glow Jelly Cream stacks near the top of this list, but is pretty comparable. I don't think it's any better - the Etude House is my fave - but it's just as good with a scent I enjoy.  I haven't noticed any brightening effects, but it does such a good job leaving my skin feeling really supple and hydrated from the inside, not just slick on the surface. I totally agree with you that it absorbs right in and doesn't leave a sticky film. The packaging is gorgeous, right?!

There's still a plastic bottle inside, but the idea is to use LESS plastic, unlike the ""incredible feat of engineering"" we mightve been expecting lol. Which is fair to expect, considering the way they've marketed it and labelled it.

Most of the Innisfree ones I‚Äôve tried are meant for casual use so commuting, running errands, etc

Asians also tend to use multiple means of sun protection so hats, long clothes, and even sun patches are part of sun protection. Sunscreen is not the standalone solution. 

There‚Äôs also the aspect of UVA ratings.

I use Hada Labo Gokyujun Premium and really love it, but there‚Äôs also Torriden Dive In, ISNTREE Ultra-low Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum, mixsoon Glacier Water Hyaluronic Acid Serum and more. 

The rice I would suggest to you would be 9 Wishes Rice Water masks, there‚Äôs so much serum in it that I can do a mask, save the serum in the pack in a ziplock and then use it the next day as a serum or essence step. The masks come in packs of ten but if you do the leftover serum trick you can get 20 days out of the pack. They make my skin feel so moisturized and soft. I also have seen these at TJ max and Marshall‚Äôs for $9.99. They have licorice and ferments as well to help brighten and lighten spots or melasma. 

If you don‚Äôt want a mask then you could try Beauty of Joseon Glow Deep Serum Rice + Alpha Arbutin.

I then tried OCM with mineral oil as I realised I was allergic to certain oils like safflower and hemp seed oil, but no luck there either. Around this time I settled for the Aveeno Daily Moisturising Lotion which I‚Äôve been using since, and kept a simple routine until I started chemical exfoliation this summer.



**Journey with BHA and AHA‚Äôs:**

Aug 15: Started using Stridex Maximum Strength Pads every other night. Increased to every night a week later, but got new spots the next day, so went back to every other night. I hardly got any new random spots on my face since using Stridex which is why I kept using it, but it did nothing for my CC‚Äôs.

Aug 28: Started using Nip+Fab Glycolic Fix Extreme Night Pads every other night. Didn‚Äôt notice any difference to skin.

Sep 20: Stopped using Nip+Fab. Only Stridex now.

Sep 27: Started using COSRX AHA every other night. New spots appeared so I cut back to every 4 days.

Oct 27: Went back to using COSRX AHA every other night.

Nov 21: Stopped using Stridex. Only COSRX AHA now.

Dec 21: Realised my CC‚Äôs had significantly reduced/gone. It was a very gradual process, I just remember looking into the mirror last week and thinking, wait, didn‚Äôt I used to have lots of small spots on my forehead? 

(Edit: After the popularity of this post, I had another look through my selfies and my CC's appear to have started reducing mid-November. I was preoccupied with things that I hadn't noticed until recently. That means it still worked whilst I was using Stridex too, and cutting Stridex out made no difference to my progress.)



**(First picture taken July 31st, second picture taken December 29th)**



I am now slowly introducing COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid as my only concern now is my visible pores/SF‚Äôs. 



COSRX is my new favourite brand. I use their acne patches whenever I get the odd spot on my face and it works great. I‚Äôve also recently bought the Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser. I haven‚Äôt noticed any changes with that yet, but I think I needed to get another cleanser anyway instead of just using micellar water.

1k2huw7,"[Routine Help] Help choosing between COSRX, Paula‚Äôs Choice, and The Ordinary for oily, bumpy skin.",COSRX,SkincareAddiction,"Just to be clear, you understand that salicylic acid and BHA are the same thing, right? So, there are very few scenarios where using BOTH at salicylic acid (i.e. BHA) cleanser AND a salicylic acid containing serum or toner at the same time makes sense. 95% of the time that will be too much salicylic and will irritate and over-dry the skin. Just pick the product you want to use with salicylic acid and stick with it... two products with salicylic can be problematic. The leave-on formulas (toners and serums) will be more effective because they stay on the skin instead of getting washed off. In that case, just pick a good, fragrance-free, non-medicated cleanser and use a Salicylic Acid toner or serum.

Can you share your age (or age range)? \~That would affect my recommendations, especially regarding The Ordinary Glycolic Acid and the Cosrx AHA/BHA because both contain glycolic acid, which is better suited for older skin (ages 30+ maybe, depending on skin type). Especially the TO Glycolic, I'd only probably recommend that one for ages 40+.

If either congested pores or oily skin are your main issues, and you're under age 30-ish, then Salicylic Acid will be most helpful. If you want to also add a different style of exfoliant, go with PHAs or some more gentle AHAs like Mandelica Acid or maybe some lower strength Lactic Acid (4% or less).

Also, would you describe your skin as sensitive or not?

The only product on your list I would avoid is the snail mucin. That one is a known allergen and carries the risk of irritation. There are other skincare ingredients that will out-perform snail mucin and don't have allergens.",clear understand salicylic acid bha thing right scenarios using salicylic acid e bha cleanser salicylic acid containing serum toner time makes sense time much salicylic irritate dry skin pick product want use salicylic acid stick two products salicylic problematic leave formulas toners serums effective stay skin instead getting washed case pick good fragrance free non medicated cleanser use salicylic acid toner serum share age age range would affect recommendations especially regarding ordinary glycolic acid cosrx aha bha contain glycolic acid better suited older skin ages maybe depending skin type especially glycolic probably recommend one ages either congested pores oily skin main issues age ish salicylic acid helpful want also add different style exfoliant go phas gentle ahas like mandelica acid maybe lower strength lactic acid less also would describe skin sensitive product list would avoid snail mucin one known allergen carries risk irritation skincare ingredients perform snail mucin allergens

1k71gev,YSL LoveShine Plumping Lip Oil Gloss/ Isamaya Lip Lacq Maximising Lip Plumping Serum/ Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Oil Luminizing Lip Oil ‚ÄòN Gloss,Fenty Beauty,Sephora,"Giving my opinion/review on three purple/lavender lip products based on my experience; it may differ from others. 

* Yves Saint Laurent LoveShine Plumping Lip Oil Gloss with Hyaluronic Acid; color: 01 Thunder Stealer (sheer icy lavender shimmer) 
It does plump as the name suggests. It does have a strong smell (It does smell like Ginger, but I don‚Äôt mind it. For some it may be too much! The smell still lingers after applying it.) Lips look juicy when applied and you may experience a tingling sensation. It‚Äôs not sticky, and the color is like a grey lavender on the lips, but very faded with pink/lavender sparkles. The formula is in between thick and light. It feels hydrating. [I also picked this same formula in 04 Honey Pure Love (sheer rose brown), 07 Strawberry  Star (sheer poppy pink) and 44 Nude Lavalliere (iconic pink nude). Out of the 4 colors, I really liked ‚ÄúHoney pure love‚Äù and ‚ÄúNude lavalliere‚Äù the most, those look AMAZING!!!!)] Overall, I like that the doe foot is wide enough to get the product out with ease, and some of the ingredients contain panthenol, hyaluronic acid and vitamin E. the packaging looks luxurious and pretty. The formula reminds me so much of the ‚ÄúLawless Forget The Filler Lip Plumper Line Smoothing Gloss‚Äù. Both do the same, in terms of plumping, and the difference imo is the smell, I feel Lawless smells more fruity/sweet, but it does contain less product as in 3.3ml for $26, and YSL 6ml for $40. If you were to choose between those two, it‚Äôs up to what you are willing to pay in terms of component, packaging and also the availability of colors, smell, etc. 

* Isamaya Lip Lacq- Maximising Lip Plumping Serum; color: Ultraviolet (pink shimmer)  
The doe foot is thinner than YSL & Fenty. It has a nice sheen, [but it‚Äôs not super reflective as the Fenty], Isamaya does last longer on the lips. Also it doesn‚Äôt have an intensified color, Isamaya is more sheer. It does feel more like a treatment to condition your lips. I dislike the wand, because I have full lips, and it takes me at least more than 5 times to get the product out. I wish it had a thicker doe foot applicator. The color is transparent with pink sparkles/shimmer. It‚Äôs not sticky. This is the type of serum you pick when you feel like your lips are dry ASF. It does moisturize the lips well. It felt lightweight. Love that the packaging feels heavy. It does look luxurious. I didn‚Äôt feel like it ‚Äúplumps‚Äù as well as the YSL or the Lawless, tbh. However, I give it 4 stars out of 5 for being hydrating. I also picked the ‚ÄúBlack Veil‚Äù which is a ‚Äúdeep purple‚Äù color and that one is hands down unique (this does have more pigment when applied on the lips), I have nothing like it in my collection. The color itself it‚Äôs worth buying it. [Wish it came more product for what it‚Äôs worth (2.5ml for $38). That‚Äôs my only critique.] It has a pleasant minty smell. Some of the ingredients contain: hyaluronic acid, coffee bean extract, vitamin E, ginger and soybean oil. 

* Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Oil Luminizing Lip Oil ‚ÄòN Gloss, color: Miss Jellyfish (sparkling icy lilac) 

It is more shimmery than both YSL Thunder and Isamaya Ultraviolet imo. It has blue sparkles/shimmer. I feel I have to reapply the product more often with this lipgloss/oil. The formula is not that thick or thin, medium viscosity. It‚Äôs not sticky. It does feel hydrating when applied. This is the type of gloss you carry on the go for when you want to say ‚ÄúQu√≠tate tu pa‚Äô ponerme yo‚Äù (Take off you to put me on) it‚Äôs a song by the way; sorry got off tracks. For me, Fenty glosses will always be the ‚ÄúIt girl.‚Äù The girl that knows what she is doing, when to do it, and how it‚Äôs done. Love that the doe foot applicator is thicker on this one, so two swipes and bam you go it. The smell is pleasantly sweet. Kudos for that. Lips look so pretty/juicy with this on. I also picked the color ‚ÄúRose Amber‚Äù that one is beautiful too; it‚Äôs like a brown/coffee color imo. Some of the ingredients are vitamin E and hyaluronic acid. 9ml for $26 

In conclusion: do you need all three? No. You don‚Äôt. 
But, up to you on what you are looking for.
For more pigmented - Fenty Miss jellyfish lip oil/gloss. 
More hydrating- Isamaya lip plumping serum.
Plumping- YSL or [Lawless as another option.] :)  YSL is also more pigmented but in the other colors.

Which one makes your lips more JUICY? I would say YSL but in the other colors like Honey Pure Love, or Nude Lavalliere. Fenty as well. 

Packaging wise: YSL beats this one, but Isamaya is lovely too (¬¨_¬¨ just the damn thin doe foot.) Almost forgot, the Isamaya has braille in the packaging. That was nice. 

-
None of them were sticky for me, so that‚Äôs a plus too. ‚ùõ ÷ä ‚ùõ

13dz43h,Fenty Beauty Digital Event Attendee Gift,Fenty Beauty,Sephora,"This is the attendee gift from the recent Fenty Beauty Digital Event (100 point reward redemption). Included are:

* Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara deluxe sample (3.5 ml, $6.65 value based on full sized price)
* Sephora Branded Travel Jewelry Case

And to proactively answer the questions people typically ask when I post these :) :

* Information on Digital Events can be found at: [https://www.sephora-events.com/](https://www.sephora-events.com/)
* Digital Events are available to US and Canadian residents
* A Sephora branded item is included with each attendee gift; the item changes each month
* New events are posted towards the beginning of the month.  Shortly after that, some members are sent an email with information on that month‚Äôs Sephora branded item and with signup links.  Sometime during the month general registration opens through the website, and there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any rhyme or reason to when (best to just keep checking)
* While all events offer an attendee gift, the event description may or may not state what the brand attendee gift will be; if it doesn't and you don't like surprises, you can email [RSVP@Sephora.com](mailto:RSVP@Sephora.com) to find out what it will be
* There is no set time for when they send out attendee gifts; in my experience it ranges from weeks to months
* They do not send emails to notify that these gifts are being shipped out, they just show up
* The closest you can get to being notified of shipping for these attendee gifts is via UPS's My Choice feature, where UPS will email you shortly before they are going to deliver a package (any package) to you.  Sephora outsources delivery of the attendee gifts to a promo company called Arrowhead Promotions, and they ship via UPS
* Based on anecdotal evidence in this sub, you will still get the attendee gift if you registered for the event but didn't end up attending.  However, you must attend the entire event to be eligible to win the big prizes.",attendee gift recent fenty beauty digital event point reward redemption included hella thicc volumizing mascara deluxe sample ml value based full sized price sephora branded travel jewelry case proactively answer questions people typically ask post information digital events found digital events available us canadian residents sephora branded item included attendee gift item changes month new events posted towards beginning month shortly members sent email information month sephora branded item signup links sometime month general registration opens website appear rhyme reason best keep checking events offer attendee gift event description may may state brand attendee gift like surprises email rsvp com mailto rsvp com find set time send attendee gifts experience ranges weeks months send emails notify gifts shipped show closest get notified shipping attendee gifts via ups choice feature ups email shortly going deliver package package sephora outsources delivery attendee gifts promo company called arrowhead promotions ship via ups based anecdotal evidence sub still get attendee gift registered event end attending however must attend entire event eligible win big prizes

1k33ob8,Fenty setting spray ‚Äî Not itttttt,Fenty,Sephora,"Many setting sprays, particularly those labelled ‚Äòlong-wear,‚Äô contain alcohol to help the makeup dry quickly and stay in place. On dry or normal skin, this can dehydrate the surface, disrupting the foundation and causing it to lift or separate.

Fenty‚Äôs spray likely relies on film-formers to lock everything in place, but if your foundation isn‚Äôt fully dry or the products underneath aren‚Äôt quite right together, it can trap moisture or unset product, causing pilling. Also, if there‚Äôs too much glycerin or silicone in the formula, it could create a slippery texture, leading to separation or clumping when you touch your face. Over-saturation is another factor - if the mist isn‚Äôt very fine or it sprays unevenly, some areas might end up wetter than others, leading to patchiness or a peeling effect.

Try spraying it over some foundation on the back of your hand and see how it dries. It‚Äôs often easier to identify the issue when it‚Äôs not directly on your face",many setting sprays particularly labelled long wear contain alcohol help makeup dry quickly stay place dry normal skin dehydrate surface disrupting foundation causing lift separate fenty spray likely relies film formers lock everything place foundation fully dry products underneath quite right together trap moisture unset product causing pilling also much glycerin silicone formula could create slippery texture leading separation clumping touch face saturation another factor mist fine sprays unevenly areas might end wetter others leading patchiness peeling effect try spraying foundation back hand see dries often easier identify issue directly face

1dr1tvo,Fenty Major Flex...she's finally here!,Fenty,Sephora,"Mini review:

Packaging: Interesting attention to detail with the smiley faces. I appreciate the keycap even though I have no use for it. The inside of the box is also decorated, which is a pleasant touch.

Product: such a unique colour and the perfect amount of shimmer. The rainbow shimmers inside dance beautifully in the sunlight. As someone who does not have very pigmented lips, this does show up on my lips with a black hue (duh)...but I love it. It adds dimension and gives the appearance of fuller lips imo.

1db0boi,Yes/no to Tarte‚Äôs Tubing Mascara?,Tarte,Sephora,"I have tried both. Caliray is the blackest mascara I have ever used.

I use Bioderma on a cotton pad, then warm-hot water on a cotton pad, then cleansing balm in conjunction with a warm, wet makeup eraser. Yet mascara crumbles somehow find their way into my eyes through all this. Caliray is more problematic for this by a significant-but-not-huge margin.

14roj5w,How is Glossier doing at Sephora?,Glossier,Sephora,"I think it‚Äôs helped them a lot where I live in Orange County. I usually see teenage girls and their moms in the glossier section of my local Sephora and I think people get more gratification from buying a product in person and not having to meet a free shipping minimum. Plus in my area driving to LA to see the glossier store is kind of inconvenient. 

I think most of their products are pretty accessibly priced for a brand carried at Sephora (right around $20) and it makes it easy for someone to check something out and decide to purchase. I‚Äôve purchased an ultra lip, a liner, and I‚Äôll probably purchase the lidstar next time I go because the price point makes it an easy impulse buy for me. I take a lot more time to think about making a prestige brand purchase but with glossier I go ‚Äúoh what the hell it‚Äôs $20.‚Äù",think helped lot live orange county usually see teenage girls moms glossier section local sephora think people get gratification buying product person meet free shipping minimum plus area driving la see glossier store kind inconvenient think products pretty accessibly priced brand carried sephora right around makes easy someone check something decide purchase purchased ultra lip liner probably purchase lidstar next time go price point makes easy impulse buy take lot time think making prestige brand purchase glossier go oh hell

1133x01,In depth Glossier review ft. Years of thoughts!,Glossier,Sephora,"Regardless if you‚Äôre personally hyped about it, Glossier and Sephora is a LONG overdue merger. The customer base forth both has wanted to see them together for years, and as a someone who once was a Glossier ‚Äúpurist‚Äù, I thought it might be helpful to share my years worth of experiences with the products. 

Starting with my favorite, the skin tint! If I had to pick one word to describe her, other than water, it would be polarizing. This is without question a love it or hate it product and there is absolutely no meeting in the middle. The texture is super fluid, so if you‚Äôre like me and can‚Äôt deal with anything feeling heavy on your face, this is a win. Let me just say though, if covers nothing. Active acne, scars, and hyperpigmentation will win the war and show directly through whatever micro amount of coverage this gives. For context, the original Chanel water foundation could camouflage more, and that‚Äôs saying something. Aside from the way it feels, the effect lands somewhere between 8 hours of sleep and a Time Machine having a baby. My definitely doesn‚Äôt look covered, but it does look GOOD. 

The stretch concealer is actually what I use when I want a little something extra. I saw Katie Jane Hughes (if you‚Äôre unfamiliar she‚Äôs a literal gift from the makeup gods) use this as foundation, I think that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs best served. It‚Äôs sheer and dewy, but does enough that I definitely feel elevated after. As far as creasing goes, I don‚Äôt care who you are, you need to set this with powder. Otherwise you don‚Äôt stand a chance.   Speaking of powder, Wowder is great and is a holy grail product for me, I‚Äôm just out so it‚Äôs omitted from the photo. Hate the stupid net though and usually cut it open. 

Gen G, their matte lip, was beautiful and revolutionary for its time, but there‚Äôs better blotted lip formulas out there now, at least in my experience. Ultralip though, she‚Äôs the QUEEN of glossy lipsticks. One swipe pigment but never too much, my lips actually feel softer after I use them, and Villa specifically makes me look like I got 2 CC‚Äôs of lip injections.

If you‚Äôre reading this you‚Äôre probably new to Glossier, so I‚Äôll so spare you the in depth comparison of the new Balm Dot Com vs. the OG formula. Summary version though? The makeover was a great decision! It‚Äôs a wonderful occlusive that‚Äôs really protective! A go to of mine when I‚Äôm at the gym and breathing hard through my mouth; totally saves my lips from getting destroyed.  The tinted have beautiful washes of color, especially wild fig. But remember! These are meant to be therapeutic, and that color won‚Äôt last. 

Lidstar, or really any of the eye shadows, aren‚Äôt worth your money or my breath. They‚Äôre a skincare first, makeup second brand, and as such their makeup definitely performs like an after thought.

I don't predict them doing well on Sephora. 

Their bronzer and eyeshadow palette are two of the worst products I've ever used. The reformulation of BDC was also a huge blow to their general consumer base.

The new formula is horrible. I think Lanolips has probably tripled their orders since it changed.

The reformulation of their You perfume also remains kind of suspect.

1kh8jb0,Has anyone tried the laneige bubble tea lip balms?,Laneige,Sephora,"Yes!!!! They are really nice.

Both have a milky tint, the taro one is slightly more flattering (on me at least) because it‚Äôs a pale purple opposed to the pale green of the matcha one, but I would say both are wearable with enough blending out/ rubbing in.

The texture is similar to Laneige Lip Glaze Craze, not too sticky. The color gives a pastel, milky finish on the lip, not purple though. It‚Äôs like a milky finish on my natural lip color.

15fhbr9,Has anyone tried Innisfree?,Innisfree,Sephora,"I recently went on an Innisfree SPREE and I love or like everything from them so far.

(literally get it it's $16 and best spf i've ever used - my skin absorbs it like real moisturizer and no pilling/white cast), the Cherry Blossom Dewy Glow Jelly cream, and the cherry blossom spray (although i bet there are good dupes for this one, too). The Green Tea balancing emulsion has been amazing too. My skin is so soft and feels so hydrated but also clean from using these all.

Products that I also have been using a while and really like but aren't *life changing* for me are the Green Tea HA serum & moisturizer. These are both very nice & I might repurchase the serum if I don't find a better one, but I'm not as *obsessed* with these as I am the ones I described above.

Products that are newer & haven't been using as long to give meaningful reviews are the Youth Enhancing Treatment Essence and the serum. I have only used about 2x so I'm gonna hold off before I share my opinions. But so far so good.

This is a nice, light hydrating serum - no bells or whistles, but it's a perfect moisturizing serum for any skin type I think. If you have dry skin, it's nice for layering between your toner and richer day cream, at least that's how I use it. Or sometimes I apply it right after a shower while my skin is still damp so it doesn't dry out before Im not ready to do my full skincare routine (like a placeholder hydrator haha). I don't mind the scent, it's light and fresh.

But....

This new packaging....

Clense with the Bija Clarifying Innisfree foam while brushing my teeth. Lather it up and let IT SET. Brush teeth for two to three minutes, and do not wash it off until you have finished brushing!

Use the Daily Defense Innisfree Sunscreen on your entire face and neck. Generously, because let's be real, I'm not going to reapply sunscreen during the day. If you have hyperpigmentation spots. Dab a bit of the sunblock on those spots and let it sit for at least five minutes before rubbing it in.

For stubborn acne, use the Innisfree Retinol Cica Focusing Patch. It's your standard pimple patches, badass grandma. It gets out ingrown hairs, it gets out pus and grime, and it gets out black heads! The only problem is you get nine patches for $24.00, so use this sparingly!

1etfem6,Are the Fenty Gloss Bomb Stix similar to any KBeauty or CBeauty lip products?,Fenty,AsianBeauty,"If it's only based on similar packaging, you can also add this Into You lipstick into the mix. It seems to melt very easily though, I see multiple Chinese influencers getting them in PR & had the bullet broke on them just after a few uses. It's very glossy & shiny, but no one says it's long lasting or transfer-resistant. Plus there's no shade that really calls out to me, so I didn't get any of them. Mistine has a line of lipsticks in this same-ish packaging too (theirs are more detailed. Mistine has always has the most standout packaging). I feel like Mistine is very overpriced so I never tried them either. And if I already consider Mistine pricey, I likely will never shell out money for Fenty lol üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Out of these 4 I have only tried the Joocyee (love them, I own several of them for good reason. Search for ""Joocyee Glazed Rouge"" and you can find me raving about them in details several times üòÇ) & the Judydoll in person. I tried the Judydoll in one of their displays in Guardian. I didn't get one because I wasn't impressed. The packaging felt really cheap, the lipstick is very pigmented,  it's shiny but I wouldn't say it has a gloss, the shine it leaves isn't that thick & even.  It's like a shiny, very pigmented lip balm, but it doesn't last. You can count on the strong pigmentation to remain after eating & drinking, but it transfers a lot. Whereas the Joocyee is film-forming & transfers very little on non-absorbent surfaces (cups, bowls, plastic straws vs masks or clothes). Joocyee is also pigmented, but it's buildable, from a sheer layer to fully opaque. It's also very comfortable to wear & reapply, and non sticky. Unfortunately, it has the same problem as the Into You lipsticks & many other glossy lip product in stick form, which is it melts really easily though. I mostly haven't had any problem so far by following their advice, only roll up 1-2mm of product reach time I use it. Still, one of mine broke from its base just from the heat of my fingers alone (I never even took it outside, leaving it in my warm pockets or hot vehicle or anything) ü•≤ As long as I don't roll it up more than recommended, I can still use the lipstick like always though.

mgin7o,[Review] Possible AB dupe alert for Glossier Milky Jelly Cleanser,Glossier,AsianBeauty,"Hey! So I've been a huge fan of the Heimish All Clean Green Foam for a while now. I love the firm jelly consistency of the cleanser as it feels super gentle and also has a slight lather which is always enjoyable. This cleanser always makes my skin feel hydrated after I wash my face, and I also love how it has no scent. All of this at such an affordable price point, yes please! (US$7.50 in my country)

The consistency of this cleanser got me thinking about a popular Western cleanser that I've heard many people rave about - Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser. Before today, I had never tried it because of the high price point, and it also is quite difficult to get a hold of in my country. However, I did manage to snag a sample because I always suspected that it might be similar to my Heimish cleanser. 

Upon using it, the consistency of the Glossier cleanser definitely reminded me of my HG Heimish Cleanser. If I had to differentiate, I'd say Glossier's jelly consistency is slightly loose in comparison to Heimish's viscous/dense jelly consistency. 

Another difference would definitely be the scent. Seems to me like the Glossier cleanser has a floral scent. At first, it didn't seem too offensive. But I do think I'd get a bit annoyed of it upon more uses, had I purchased a full size bottle. 

Next, is the lathering. Heimish's cleanser has a slight lather, but I couldn't get the Glossier one to lather at all. Is that how it is supposed to be? Lol. 

Lastly would be the hydration. Both offer a level of hydration after use. However, I feel like the Heimish cleanser's hydration feeling lasts longer, whereas the Glossier one is more of an instanteous hydration which dissipates after a minute or two. 

Overall, I'd say that the Heimish cleanser could definitely pass as a dupe for the Glossier Cleanser. But if I must be honest, the Heimish Cleanser is definitely a better version of the Glossier Cleanser.",hey huge fan heimish clean green foam love firm jelly consistency cleanser feels super gentle also slight lather always enjoyable cleanser always makes skin feel hydrated wash face also love scent affordable price point yes please us country consistency cleanser got thinking popular western cleanser heard many people rave glossier milky jelly cleanser today never tried high price point also quite difficult get hold country however manage snag sample always suspected might similar heimish cleanser upon using consistency glossier cleanser definitely reminded hg heimish cleanser differentiate say glossier jelly consistency slightly loose comparison heimish viscous dense jelly consistency another difference would definitely scent seems like glossier cleanser floral scent first seem offensive think get bit annoyed upon uses purchased full size bottle next lathering heimish cleanser slight lather get glossier one lather supposed lol lastly would hydration offer level hydration use however feel like heimish cleanser hydration feeling lasts longer whereas glossier one instanteous hydration dissipates minute two overall say heimish cleanser could definitely pass dupe glossier cleanser must honest heimish cleanser definitely better version glossier cleanser

VDL Lumilayer Primer gives me a similar glow to Futuredew! I prefer the fresh version since it has less of a white base than the normal version.

Innisfree has tubed balms that seem similar in scents and tints to the BDCs but I haven‚Äôt tried it myself.

I‚Äôve yet to find anything similar to Gen G but I would die for a cheaper AB dupe that had more colors!

i618yw,Innisfree My Lip Balm reviews + swatches,Glossier,AsianBeauty,"Innisfree Lip Balm review:

I purchased the Mini My Lip Balm set which came with six mini lip balms (mint, vanilla, lemon, cherry, rose, and berry). I also received a full-size mint earl grey lip balm as part of the wonder box promotional sale. For reference, I'm very pale with neutral-leaning-cool undertones (~ NW13). Overall thoughts at the end. 

(Edit: [Here](https://us.innisfree.com/products/spill-the-equali-tea-lip-balm-set) is the link to buy the mini set  and [here](https://us.innisfree.com/collections/lip-gloss/products/my-lip-balm) is the link to buy the regular full sizes balms in the U.S.)

Green Peppermint Tea: Clear lip balm. No glittery shimmer, but a fair bit of shine. The mint smell is quite strong, and unfortunately I dislike the smell of mint. Probably my least favorite.

Sky Vanilla Tea: Comes out of the tube pastel blue but turns to a sheer light baby pink on the skin. Absolutely heavenly birthday cake smell. Just adds a subtle boost to my natural lip color.

Homemade Lemon Tea: Comes out of the tube pastel yellow but turns to a sheer warm light pink on the skin. I completely adore the sweet lemon scent. Another one that subtly boosts natural lip color, but with a warmer tone. Possibly my favorite. 

Mint Earl Grey: Soft peachy pink color. Just described as peach on the website but pulls a bit cooler on me. I love the subtle sweet scent but can't pick out what it is (not at all minty like the name suggests). A step up from natural-looking lip color, but still very subtle. Like an enhanced version of my lip color. Also possibly my favorite.

Sunkissed Cherry Tea: Bolder reddish pink color. Not ""neon red"" like it says on the website but definitely more intense than the other colors. The scent was very very subtle, almost undetectable. Though that's a good thing for me because I don't care for cherry scent. 

Dried Rose Tea: Warm reddish-pink color with a touch of coral. Not quite ""red tangerine"" as it's described online, but still a lovely shade. The rose scent is pleasant and not overly sweet, more like refreshing rosewater. I could probably build this color to be more intense with another layer. 

Very Berry Tea: A rich cool berry shade, although less purple than I expect to see in berry-colored lip products. More like berry-influenced pink. Pleasant berry scent, very much like berry scented chapsticks I had as a kid. Unfortunately, this one has a defect. When I squeezed the product tube for the first time to apply it, there was a popping sound and the tube deflated. It seems that it was filled mostly with air rather than product by accident. I would be very irritated if I'd bought a full size version, but it's a mini and not even close to my favorite so it's just mildly disappointing. 

Overall/general thoughts: I love these lip balms! The scents are lovely and the colors are very wearable on a daily basis. The formula is very smooth and glides onto the skin easily. It's also quite hydrating for a good couple hours, and the tint lasts long after the shine fades which is a cool feature I haven't noticed in American lip balms. I would definitely repurchase vanilla, lemon, and mint earl grey. Maybe rose or cherry as well for a good red color. I also really want to try wild hibiscus, ruby grapefruit tea, and wedding peach tea in the future. 

Compared to Glossier balm dotcom: I've frequently seen these lip balms compared to the Glossier balm dotcoms or suggested as dupes. I only have the cherry balm dotcom, but I would have to agree that these are a great alternative. The glossier balm is much more difficult to fully apply to the skin, I think because it's more of a solid vaseline-esque formula than a smooth balm. Overall, it feels less hydrating, less long-lasting, and stickier than the innisfree lip balms. I also HATE the strong cherry scent of the Glossier product. That said, I don't think there's a perfect match between the Glossier shades and the innisfree shades, though you can probably find fairly close matches for most. Glossier has more variety of clear scents if that's what you prefer. Innisfree is a bit cheaper if you buy individually, but the same price per product if you buy the Glossier balm dotcom trio. Maybe I should try more balm dotcom shades, but as of now I strongly prefer Innisfree.",innisfree lip balm review purchased mini lip balm set came six mini lip balms mint vanilla lemon cherry rose berry also received full size mint earl grey lip balm part wonder box promotional sale reference pale neutral leaning cool undertones nw overall thoughts end edit link buy mini set link buy regular full sizes balms u green peppermint tea clear lip balm glittery shimmer fair bit shine mint smell quite strong unfortunately dislike smell mint probably least favorite sky vanilla tea comes tube pastel blue turns sheer light baby pink skin absolutely heavenly birthday cake smell adds subtle boost natural lip color homemade lemon tea comes tube pastel yellow turns sheer warm light pink skin completely adore sweet lemon scent another one subtly boosts natural lip color warmer tone possibly favorite mint earl grey soft peachy pink color described peach website pulls bit cooler love subtle sweet scent pick minty like name suggests step natural looking lip color still subtle like enhanced version lip color also possibly favorite sunkissed cherry tea bolder reddish pink color neon red like says website definitely intense colors scent subtle almost undetectable though good thing care cherry scent dried rose tea warm reddish pink color touch coral quite red tangerine described online still lovely shade rose scent pleasant overly sweet like refreshing rosewater could probably build color intense another layer berry tea rich cool berry shade although less purple expect see berry colored lip products like berry influenced pink pleasant berry scent much like berry scented chapsticks kid unfortunately one defect squeezed product tube first time apply popping sound tube deflated seems filled mostly air rather product accident would irritated bought full size version mini even close favorite mildly disappointing overall general thoughts love lip balms scents lovely colors wearable daily basis formula smooth glides onto skin easily also quite hydrating good couple hours tint lasts long shine fades cool feature noticed american lip balms would definitely repurchase vanilla lemon mint earl grey maybe rose cherry well good red color also really want try wild hibiscus ruby grapefruit tea wedding peach tea future compared glossier balm dotcom frequently seen lip balms compared glossier balm dotcoms suggested dupes cherry balm dotcom would agree great alternative glossier balm much difficult fully apply skin think solid vaseline esque formula smooth balm overall feels less hydrating less long lasting stickier innisfree lip balms also hate strong cherry scent glossier product said think perfect match glossier shades innisfree shades though probably find fairly close matches glossier variety clear scents prefer innisfree bit cheaper buy individually price per product buy glossier balm dotcom trio maybe try balm dotcom shades strongly prefer innisfree

* consists of tocopherol (vitamin E) - an antioxidant that helps protect the skin from sun damage and has moisturizing and healing benefits.
* it has white tea leaf water - an anti-aging ingredient that is rich in antioxidants that protect your skin from sun damage, making your skin youthful and healthy.
* there is meadowfoam seed oil - a plant oil that moisturizes and soothes skin and helps protect damage from UVB rays.

Review:

This toner worked a lot better on my skin than I expected. I use this at night, and it replenishes my skin with hydration very well. It‚Äôs super lightweight and can double up as a moisturizer because of how much hydration it provides. My skin tends to be more on the drying side, so I layer up with other products after using this as a toner. But this product can be used alone, finishing with a moisturizer, after cleansing your face. There is somewhat of a layer of residue formed after using this, but that is most likely due to the high amount of moisture this product provides. My face stays hydrated throughout the night, making my skin supple and smooth in the morning. 

How to use:

After cleansing your face, pour the toner onto a cotton pad and swipe it all over your face. Let the product dry for a few seconds, absorbing into your skin, before applying other products.

ac42bl,[Review] Laneige Cream Skin Refiner,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"I was online shopping as usual when I saw that Laneige launched a new product - Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, which was a toner-cream hybrid. It seemed popular in Korea + the concept of toner-cream hybrid seems pretty interesting, so I decided to order one and try it out for myself.

I wrote a review on it on my blog after trying it for over a month. Link above for those interested.

# Summary of the blog post:

**What is it?** A very interesting product with the moisturizing properties of a moisturizer but texture of a lotion/toner.

**Texture:** Absorbs rather quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave a sticky feel that many moisturizers do. It does leave some minor stickiness if I over-apply though.

**Did it break me out?** Not at all. As someone with acne-prone, sensitive, oily but dehydrated skin, I struggled a lot with finding a moisturizer suitable for my skin. I even went without using a moisturizer for years just because I couldn‚Äôt find any that wouldn‚Äôt break me out. The fact that it didn‚Äôt break me out is one of the key reasons why I love this so much.

**Effectiveness/Performance:** It is crazily moisturizing for something so lightweight. I suspect people with dry skin/living in a dry climate may still need to use a cream with Laneige Cream Skin Refiner, but people with oily skin/living in humid climate can probably get away with using Laneige Cream Skin Refiner as a moisturizer.

**Pros:**

* Lightweight texture
* Absorbs quickly
* Extremely moisturizing
* Does not break me out
* A little goes a long way

**Cons:**

* Slight stickiness if over-applied (although that is more of a user error than product flaw)

**Overall rating:** 5/5. I LOVE this, ‚Äônuff said. There‚Äôs no reason to hate it ‚Äì Laneige Cream Skin Refiner can serve as both a moisturizer or a highly-moisturizing toner depending on skin types and climates. Sure, it may not be as amazing to people with naturally good skin and thus have a huge selection of products to choose from. However, for skin types like mine that struggle with finding a moisturizer, this is a rare gem.",online shopping usual saw laneige launched new product laneige cream skin refiner toner cream hybrid seemed popular korea concept toner cream hybrid seems pretty interesting decided order one try wrote review blog trying month link interested summary blog post interesting product moisturizing properties moisturizer texture lotion toner texture absorbs rather quickly leave sticky feel many moisturizers leave minor stickiness apply though break someone acne prone sensitive oily dehydrated skin struggled lot finding moisturizer suitable skin even went without using moisturizer years find break fact break one key reasons love much effectiveness performance crazily moisturizing something lightweight suspect people dry skin living dry climate may still need use cream laneige cream skin refiner people oily skin living humid climate probably get away using laneige cream skin refiner moisturizer pros lightweight texture absorbs quickly extremely moisturizing break little goes long way cons slight stickiness applied although user error product flaw overall rating love nuff said reason hate laneige cream skin refiner serve moisturizer highly moisturizing toner depending skin types climates sure may amazing people naturally good skin thus huge selection products choose however skin types like mine struggle finding moisturizer rare gem
ac42bl,[Review] Laneige Cream Skin Refiner,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"""According to Laneige, the Cream Skin Refiner contains White Leaf Tea Water rich in amino acids that reinforce the skin barrier to make extremely dry and sensitive skin healthier. I guess that explains the white colour of the liquid.""


FYI, the white color is more likely due to the emulsification between the watery ingredients and oils than from the white tea, which has super light green leaves and usually brews up almost clear with a super light tannish green hue. üòÄ",according laneige cream skin refiner contains white leaf tea water rich amino acids reinforce skin barrier make extremely dry sensitive skin healthier guess explains white colour liquid fyi white color likely due emulsification watery ingredients oils white tea super light green leaves usually brews almost clear super light tannish green hue

ac42bl,[Review] Laneige Cream Skin Refiner,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"(Note: Oily, dehydrated skin. Living in the humid and tropical climate of SG)

I‚Äôve been using this for 2 weeks now and I absolutely adore this product. First, it doesn‚Äôt have any strong overpowering scent which often makes me dizzy. In fact it has a very VERY subtle mild rice scent which I LOVE, but is very unnoticeable if you aren‚Äôt as sensitive to scents as me. 

2nd: the texture is simply revolutionary. It‚Äôs slightly thicker than a toner but much much thinner than a watery/emulsifying lotion. It‚Äôs the perfect texture and being in a humid climate, I often just use this 1 layer in the day. Yup, only 1. Imagine how much time I‚Äôve saved. At night, I do use a moisturiser/thicker serum as a 2nd step.

Results after 2 weeks: my skin texture has improved. Less bumps, less oil bumps etc. Colour wise, my face definitely looks less dull and brighter! I try to avoid make-up and usually my face gets oily/sallow in mid-day (blotting powder to the rescue). But now I don‚Äôt do much touch-ups anymore. I just blot lightly with tissue and skin still looks kinda glowy. :)

So far I‚Äôm really happy with this cream skin refiner. It sells on Shopee at a really reasonable price too.

nlo0qj,[Review] Laneige Cica Sleeping Pack,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"One of my favorite products by Laneige is their water sleeping mask. But I‚Äôve been seeing this everywhere, so I simply had to get my hands on it ü§©. I recently fell in love with cica products after learning more about this beautiful ingredient, and here I am with Laneige‚Äôs Cica Sleeping Pack. What could go possibly go wrong with is combo?   
The breakdown:  
üíöGlycerin, squalene, and shea butter are fantastic for keeping your skin hydrated  
üíöAsiatic acid, asiaticoside, and madecassic acid are components of the beloved Cica/Centella Asiatic with anti-inflammatory abilites, treating acne and redness on your skin  
üíöTea tree leaf oil‚Äôs soothing and antibacterial properties are also good for treating acne and inflammation  
üíöTocopherol is a great antioxidant and helps protect your skin from sun damage   


\[Review\]: 

Unlike all the other sleeping packs I‚Äôve used, this was the best one. It‚Äôs not clear but an opaque white like a cream or moisturizer. I even thought I brought the wrong thing because it looked so much like a cream üòÖ. When I applied it to my face, man was it like a cream though! If I use this, I skip the moisturizer that night because this is super hydrating on my skin. It‚Äôs a tad bit heavy feeling but I use this at night, so I don‚Äôt really fell it. I wake up the next morning, and my skin feels so soft I tell you. This is my new favorite sleeping pack that I use about once a week to recover from the dryness and damage Michigan weather has caused. Because this has Cica ingredients, this also helps calm my acne and redness, and it leaves my skin glowy the next day.  


How to use: 

When you need a bit more hydration, switch out your regular moisturizer with this! Use the mini spatula provided a scoop out about a dime size of the mask, and apply it evenly all over your face. Wash off the next morning with your regular cleanser.

* üèÜ**Mini Pore Waterclay Mask**: Sea silt, white clay, mint. This mask is the lightest clay mask with the smoothest finish. It‚Äôs like going to the beach and playing in the silkiest sand, then emerging from the mud like Botticelli‚Äôs Birth of Venus. This is probably my favorite clay mask of all time because it leaves my skin feeling really smooth and refreshed for the entirety of the next day. A little goes a long way - I‚Äôve used it once a week for the last month. When this little jar runs out, I *will repurchase*.

* üèÜ**Water Bank Hydrating Gel**: Ceramide 3, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid. I‚Äôm cheating a bit because I finished a full size of this before even getting the trial kit. The full size took about 6 months of daily use to finish and is not part of the trial kit. The trial kit comes with a mini. I love the way the gel texture absorbs, and it is perfect for my combination skin. *Will repurchase* (and already have).

* ü§î**Mini Pore Blur Perfector**: Mint water, silica. This is a mattifying finisher that goes on after make-up - think of it like a water-based setting powder. It controls the shine from my oily t-zone, and I do like how light the product feels. However, it isn‚Äôt amazing enough that I would buy this for $32 in full. My Innisfree setting powder achieves the same results for $9. *It‚Äôs OK, but would not repurchase for myself.*

* üôÖüèª**Essential Power Skin Toner**: Quinoa seed, niacinamide. This is mostly alcohol and fragrance. I could probably re-purpose this into a perfume. It is not hydrating at all, and I feel like I‚Äôm doing a disservice to my skin by even putting it on. *Would not recommend.*

* üôÖüèª**Multi-Cleanser**: Stearic acid, matcha extract, papaya. This is a foaming cleanser that is also heavily fragranced. My face felt dry and tight after using. I was surprised since I use foaming cleansers every day (mainly the CeraVe one). *Would not recommend.*

Overall, the trial kit is a good way to test a lot of little products. I bought this for $25USD at Sephora, and it comes in a little pouch with some Laneige stickers.

bukt0h,[REVIEW]Laneige Glowy Makeup Serum,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"Laneige came out with their Glowy Makeup Serum earlier this year. It was such a hit in South Korea that I opted to buy it. Although it was on the pricier side I took the risk and ordered it.
I am so happy that I invested in this serum because it is not at all like any serum I have ever used. This serum gives you such a nice glow. It fills your pores so well. It moisturizes your skin along with doing all the primer deeds.
I have tried it with Cushion Foundations and with Western Foundations too and it works equally great under both.
It is a serum and primer in one. The results are reay amazing and in all my videos I am using this serum for natural look.

g4ebbu,[Review] Laneige Water Sleeping Mask (Lavender),Laneige,AsianBeauty,"\[Review\] Laneige Water Sleeping Mask (Lavender) 

Sleeping packs were one of the first skincare products I ever incorporated into my skincare routine, keeping my skin hydrated during the night. Every morning I wake up, the mask would leave my skin feeling soft and supple ‚ò∫Ô∏è. 

About this product:

* contains citric acid (AHA/BHA) which chemically exfoliate your skin
* there is sodium hyaluronate (derivative of hyaluronic acid) which is fantastic for hydrating your skin
* contains linalool & limonene which are plant extracts giving the lavender scent, BUT this can cause irritation on skin (like for those with sensitive skin)

Review: 

I bought this mask on a spur to simply try it out and compare it to the original Laneige Water Sleeping Mask, and for me, I personally like the original much more. This mask does its job of hydrating my skin, but not as much as compared to the original one surprisingly. It‚Äôs a clear gel mask, so it‚Äôs pretty lightweight, and it comes with a little spatula to scoop out the mask from the container (keeping your mask bacteria free!). Like the packaging states, there is a lavender scent in the product, but that disappears when you apply it onto your skin. The lavender scent supposedly helps calm and relax you, like how lavender essential oil works in aromatherapy. After looking into the ingredients this product contains, it is somewhat different than the original water sleeping mask as there are ingredients in the lavender one that can cause skin irritation to those with sensitive skin (such as linalool and limonene). In addition, amounts of key ingredients differ between the two such as sodium hyaluronate (in the lavender mask, it is towards the bottom of the ingredient list, but in the original mask, this ingredient is towards the top). In the end, I personally won‚Äôt re-purchase it again, but I‚Äôll stick with the original water sleeping mask.

How to use:

After cleansing your face and finishing your skin care routine with moisturizer, use this mask at night over your moisturizer. Use the spatula to scoop out the mask and apply it to your face, creating a light layer of it (I recommend scooping the mask out and putting it on the back of your hand to keep the spatula clean and germ-free). Leave it on for a few minutes for it to dry before sleeping. In the morning, wash the mask off with water, and follow up with your normal skincare routine. Use this mask once or twice a week.

32gav9,Review: Laneige Water Bank Eye Gel (blog),Laneige,AsianBeauty,"The link is to my blog review of Laneige's Water Bank Eye Gel, which is one of the products that recently launched at Target in the US. (I think the formula is the same as the overseas versions though.) Full disclosure: I was given this for review by a PR company, but I don't bullshit and lie if I don't like something. Honesty is fun! To quickly recap:                     
                      
- **PROS:** The cream is super-hyrating without feeling gross and suffocating like thick, creamy eye creams. The texture almost feels ""bouncy"" in a way, and it gives me a slight cooling sensation for a few minutes after I apply it. I absolutely LOVE that. The jar is also really pretty. Not the most important thing ever, but hey, why not mention it.                             
                               
- **CONS:** It's a bit expensive for the amount of product you get and fragranced. Not super-duper heavy fragranced, but definitely scented. There are a couple of ingredients that could be potential acne triggers (hasn't happened to me, but I don't have the most sensitive skin in the world.)

34y3jw,Review: Laneige Bright Renew Original Cream/White Plus Renew Original Cream (blog),Laneige,AsianBeauty,"The link goes to my blog review of Laneige Bright Renew Original Cream, which is one of the ""new"" products that launched at American Target stores in March. Full disclosure: This was given to me by a PR company, but that doesn't affect how I write my reviews. Here's the quick-n-dirty version of my thoughts/important points about this product:                           
              
- From what I can tell, this is exactly the same product as Laneige White Plus Renew Original Cream (sold outside the USA). The ingredients lists are identical. They renamed some of their products for Target, so I guess this is one of them.                
                  
- This is *not* the same as the Bright Renew Cream that was released at Target in 2014. The previous version was a night cream, while this is a lighter, more gel-like cream.                        
                    
- Speaking of things being gel-like, I was pleasantly surprised by how light this cream is. It looks super-rich in the jar but is definitely more of a gel. (Look at the pics on my [blog](http://www.helloprettybird.com/2015/05/review-laneige-bright-renew-original.html) to see what I mean.) Anyway, I can see it being useful for normal or combo skin types in warmer weather.                  
                    
- Like most Laneige products, the fragrance level is strong. Pleasant, but strong.                         
                     
- I used this cream daily for over a month and didn't see any super-dramatic results in terms of brightening, but to be honest, I'm not sure how much there is to brighten up on my skin at the moment, lol.

wld6su,Ultimate Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask collection,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"This is a long one so let‚Äôs keep it short and simple. The formula is consistent throughout the flavours imo so this is purely based on scent. I prefer fruity over sweet smells as you‚Äôll see below. 

Also before anyone comments, no you‚Äôre not the only one that hates it, yes it‚Äôs overpriced. But it‚Äôs my money and I love them so here we are. Not to mention that one jar easily lasts a year.

Berry - the OG, first one I tried and have repurchased 4.5/5 WRP

Grapefruit - light sweet citrus smell  4.5/5 WRP 

Choco Mint - no chocolate smell at all, straight up spearmint, minimal mint tingle 2/5 WNRP - 

Apple Lime - scent on this one seems more subtle than others. Just smells like lime jello to me 2/5 WNRP

Vanilla - not a fan of sweet smells, prefer fruity ones 1/5 WNRP

Sweet Candy - very similar smell to berry just a little sweeter, I prefer berry over this 4/5 WRP

Gummy Bear - smells like Japanese grape candy and I love it 5/5 WRP

Peach Iced Tea - smells exactly like peach iced tea, I wish this was a sweeter fruit smell but it‚Äôs still nice 3/5 WRP 

Lemon Sorbet - the lemon is super subtle but it gives me a lip smackers pink lemonade vibe and I‚Äôm here for it 4/5 WRP - limited edition

Peppermint - sweet peppermint smell, tingly mint feeling on the lips, my all time favourite 10/5 WRP - limited edition 

Gingersnap - smells like a gingerbread house straight outta the oven, I prefer the fruity ones 3/5 WNRP - limited edition 

Chocolate - very true chocolate smell, abs the scent is pretty strong 3/5 WNRP - limited edition 

Caramel - smells like salted caramel Candy, very sweet 3/5 - WNRP - limited edition 

Cherry Blossom - I wanted to love this one so badly, the smell is cherry and floral, leaves an unpleasant taste on the lips 1/5 WNRP - limited edition

Mango - smells like mango but not a juicy mango if that makes sense. The scent is very one dimensional 3/5 WRP - limited edition",long one let keep short simple formula consistent throughout flavours imo purely based scent prefer fruity sweet smells see also anyone comments one hates yes overpriced money love mention one jar easily lasts year berry og first one tried repurchased wrp grapefruit light sweet citrus smell wrp choco mint chocolate smell straight spearmint minimal mint tingle wnrp apple lime scent one seems subtle others smells like lime jello wnrp vanilla fan sweet smells prefer fruity ones wnrp sweet candy similar smell berry little sweeter prefer berry wrp gummy bear smells like japanese grape candy love wrp peach iced tea smells exactly like peach iced tea wish sweeter fruit smell still nice wrp lemon sorbet lemon super subtle gives lip smackers pink lemonade vibe wrp limited edition peppermint sweet peppermint smell tingly mint feeling lips time favourite wrp limited edition gingersnap smells like gingerbread house straight outta oven prefer fruity ones wnrp limited edition chocolate true chocolate smell abs scent pretty strong wnrp limited edition caramel smells like salted caramel candy sweet wnrp limited edition cherry blossom wanted love one badly smell cherry floral leaves unpleasant taste lips wnrp limited edition mango smells like mango juicy mango makes sense scent one dimensional wrp limited edition

The full size bottle of Missha Time Revolution first treatment essence is $20-30 for 150 mL, but RoseRoseShop has 30 mL samples for $2 each. So buying 5 x 30 mL samples is cheaper. Worth it if you're not buying a ton of other products as they charge shipping by weight (if you buy this alone like I did cheapest shipping to the US is $5)

On Stylevana, the best unit price for the Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum is the set of 10 bottles x 8 mL. That's $52.69/80 mL = **\~$0.66 per mL**. But if you don't wanna commit to that much serum, the next best deal is the set of 2 bottles x 8 mL, which is $11/16 mL = **\~$0.69 per mL**. That's a lot better compared to the standard $89/60 mL = **\~$1.48 per mL.**

Scent: They both smell exactly the same. Subtle strawberry scents. Laneiges smell goes away seconds after you put in on your lips where Carenels lingers slightly for a few minutes subtlety. 

Texture: Here is where they have a difference. Laneige is more of a glossy texture that stays on the lips and makes a barrier. Carenel is more of a balm like texture with an almost unnoticeable gloss. 

Color: Laneige or any of its variants (I've tried a few different ones) no color or tint. Carenel (ive tried all 3) has no color or tint except for Pomegranate (slight reddish pink tint).

Lasting power: Laneige stays glossy for about an hour with no drinking or eating. Rubs off easily. Carenel stays balmy for a few hours. Does not rub off easily. 

Moisturizing: Laneige is very moisturizing but does not heal dry lips on its own. Its better for a ""slugging"" effect. After it starts wearing down it leaves a slight oily feel on the lips. Carenel is slighty moisturizing and helps heal dry lips. Good by itself. Its fully wears down with no film on the lips afterwards. 

Final thoughts: I have used Laneiges lip sleeping mask many times as its been a common gift I've been given (Berry, Vanilla, Gummy Bear and Sweet Candy) i personally wouldn't buy it myself as i find it not moisturizing enough (also i don't support cruelty practices). If you like glossy lip balms and dont need much moisture for your lips this might be good for you as they do smell nice but not strong. Might not be best for sensitive skin. 

I have used all 3 types of Carenels lip night mask (Berry, Lime and Pomegranate) i perfer Pomegranate as i do like the smell the best. I would use this one over Laneige as i like the balmy texture better. If you like a more balmy texture this might be good for you. This one has more sensitive skin friendly ingredients but look over the ingredients to be sure. 

Overall i give Laneige a 5/10 and Carenel a 7.5/10.",care nel lip night mask berry price g g cruelty free ingredients polyisobutene mineral oil petrolatum diisostearyl malate bees wax euphorbia cerifera candelilla wax hydrogenated styrene isoprene copolymer ceresin sorbitan sesquioleate caprylyl glycol fragrance titanium dioxide polyglyceryl triisostearate synthetic fluorphlogopite hexanediol tocopheryl acetate ci ci tin oxide water olea europaea olive fruit oil butylene glycol macadamia integrifolia seed oil tocopherol lavandula angustifolia lavender flower extract rosa canina flower extract chamomilla recutita matricaria flower extract paeonia officinalis flower extract rosa centifolia flower extract camellia japonica flower extract lilium tigrinum extract rubus idaeus raspberry fruit extract fragaria chiloensis strawberry fruit extract punica granatum fruit extract tricholoma matsutake extract nelumbo nucifera flower extract schizandra chinensis fruit extract panax ginseng root extract moringa pterygosperma seed extract laneige lip sleeping mask berry price g g cruelty free ingredients diisostearyl malate hydrogenated polyisobutene phytosteryl isostearyl cetyl stearyl behenyl dimer dilinoleate hydrogenated poly c olefin polybutene microcrystalline wax butyrospermum parkii shea butter synthetic wax ethylene propylene styrene copolymer sucrose tetrastearate triacetate mica euphorbia cerifera candelilla wax candelilla wax esters astrocaryum murumuru seed butter fragrance glyceryl caprylate titanium dioxide ci butylene ethylene styrene copolymer polyglyceryl diisostearate copernicia cerifera carnauba wax methicone polyglyceryl triisostearate cocos nucifera coconut oil limonene ascorbic acid linalool glycerin propanediol bht punica granatum fruit juice rubus idaeus raspberry juice vitis vinifera grape juice water pentaerythrityl tetra di butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate brilliant blue fcf ci silica pentaerythrityl tetra di butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate purified water lithol rubine b quinoline yellow ws ci quinoline yellow ws sunset yellow fcf theobroma cacao cocoa seed butter benzyl benzoate citral brilliant blue fcf scent smell exactly subtle strawberry scents laneiges smell goes away seconds put lips carenels lingers slightly minutes subtlety texture difference laneige glossy texture stays lips makes barrier carenel balm like texture almost unnoticeable gloss color laneige variants tried different ones color tint carenel ive tried color tint except pomegranate slight reddish pink tint lasting power laneige stays glossy hour drinking eating rubs easily carenel stays balmy hours rub easily moisturizing laneige moisturizing heal dry lips better slugging effect starts wearing leaves slight oily feel lips carenel slighty moisturizing helps heal dry lips good fully wears film lips afterwards final thoughts used laneiges lip sleeping mask many times common gift given berry vanilla gummy bear sweet candy personally buy find moisturizing enough also support cruelty practices like glossy lip balms dont need much moisture lips might good smell nice strong might best sensitive skin used types carenels lip night mask berry lime pomegranate perfer pomegranate like smell best would use one laneige like balmy texture better like balmy texture might good one sensitive skin friendly ingredients look ingredients sure overall give laneige carenel

y96od6,"The battle of milky toners: Laneige, Ceuracle, Thank you farmer, Mary&May, IPSA. Review in comments!",Laneige,AsianBeauty,"I recently realized that I absolutely love milky toners and it seems there are more and more on the market. Naturally, I want to try all of them, which is completely unnecessary I know but that's the hole I decided to dig for myself. So far I got to try five of them, so here is a rundown.

**My skin type:** combination, acne prone, used to be sensitive but now not su much. It has actually changed a bit recently. I used to use topical isotretinoin 0.5 and this shit was straight up VODKA... I loathed it...even though it kept my acne at bay. So I switched to tret micro 0.4 and it's pretty drying, I started having some dry patches so I need more moisture. Apart from that, my issues are hyperpigmentation and dull skin due to smoking like a chimey (lame I know).

**Why do I love milky toners so much over regular toners?** Because due to my skin type, I can't use most heavy creams since they give me CCs, but I still need moisture and they are a perfect way to get that. So what I'm looking for in a milky toner is moisturising power BUT with a comfortable user experience, as in, I don't want to feel sticky or oily.  If I can get some glow I'll take it!

So how do they compare?

**Laneige Cream Skin Refiner**: this is the OG, I went through 3 bottles of it and loved it dearly before I inevitably got bored of it. It's marketed as a moisturiser in a bottle and I totally get that. It has strong occlusive properties and there's a whole summer where I used that as my last step (I mean before sunscreen) instead of a cream. I also  loved how I could just shower after a workout in the afternoon and apply that alone instead of doing my full routine. The downside is that, as many people have noticed, it does leave a residue on the skin which  might bother you. However if you have dry skin or if you are looking for that occlusiveness, it is perfect. Run down of ingredients: alcohol free, fragrance free, HA free, miacinimide free. Got meadowfoam seed oil and green tea extract. 

**Dr. Ceuracle Vegan Kombucha essence**: i went through one bottle of it. Strong skintertainment properties with this one as it looks like a milky tea that you have to shake before use. I found it to be very moisturising and pleasant to use, without the stickiness of the skin refiner, but also maybe less occlusive. Texture wise I think it is a bit more creamy than the laneige one but it's still pretty watery, the skin feels silky after application and its not sticky at all. I do find this gives me a nice glow after prolonged use, probably due to the ferments (i didn't have anything else with ferments in my routine). Alcohol free, fragrance free, niacinamide free. Contains HA, saccharomyces ferment filtrate, centella asiatica, green tea extract,ceramides, and a bunch of other plant extracts and oils.

**Thank You Farmer Rice Pure Essential Toner**: You cant tell on the picture but i went through half the bottle already. Out of all of them this one is defo the most lightweight and it sinks right into the skin. I personally didn't find it moisturising enough but if you have oily skin it might be a good pick. However I do find it pretty brightening as it does contain niacinamide, and maybe the rice extract does that? Overall it's a really good product! Alcohol free, fragrance free, HA free. Contains niacinamide, ceramide, centella, rice extract and a bunch of  plant extracts.

**IPSA ME 3**: this one is a bit complicated because it comes in EIGHT different versions PLUS FOUR versions for sensitive skin. I got the number 3 of the regular line, number 1 and 2 being watery toners and number 3 and up being milky. Its decribed as suited for partially oily skin but with dry areas. I love that it comes in a pump and the sleek packaging (I'm so superficial but seriously pumps are awesome), but i wish it was a little more hydrating for me since I switched to tret micro and i have dry patches. Also, it does contain alcohol which doesn't bother me that much (it does smell a but though) but I'm hesitant to layer it due to that because I don't want to irritate my skin. Another thing that got me really interested is that it has tranexamic acid, which I didn't have in my routine and was really interested about for it's brightening effect. Texture wise, it's the most viscous out of all of them and feels really hydrating on top of being moisturizing, leaving absolutely no sticky feeling. Really interesting formulation. Not sure i notice any brightening effect as of yet but I've only been using it for a month. I'm going to use it all and when I'm done I'll go up in number and see what the richer ones are like because i really like it! Note that the sensitive line is without alcohol. Basically it'sa great product but be careful when you pick the version. Not sure about the whole ingredient list but it's fragrance free.

**Mary&May Vegan Blackberry Complex Cream Essence:** I have to admit that the only reason I picked this is because it looks like a copy of the ceuracle kombucha one except its pink. Honestly, i don't see a difference between them. Made by the same manufacturer? Idk. I did a  test where I put each essence on my arms to compare the feeling and if there's a difference, I can't tell, same silky and non sticky feeling. Ceuracle seems more interesting due to the ferments and the green tea, however maybe the blackberries have interesting proteries? Can't tell you about the long term effects since I just received it. Alcohol free, fragrance free, niacinamide free. Contains HA, centella asiatica, jojoba seed oil, Ceramide, blackberry extract.

So basically I think these are all great products and it would just be a matter of fining the one that is more suited fir your skin. They were all pretty moisturizing to varying degrees, if not with one layer then with a couple.

I wanted to rate them in term of glowiness but honestly I don't know! Its so hard to tell sonce i use so many products for that already. I'd say go by the ingredient you prefer, whether it's  niacinamide (TYF), ferments (Ceuracle) or tranexamic acid (IPSA), these three have good potential.

1jwim9d,Decorte vs Laneige Neo Loose Powder for dry skin,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"I haven't tried the Decorte one, but the Laneige one feels really dry on my skin, even in the height of summer in Asia. It does control my oil/sweat pretty well though throughout the day. It's just that the initial application and first few hours make my skin feel like I powdered with chalk. The Canmake Marshmallow powder in comparison feels like it has more ""body"" and silkiness to it on my skin compared to the Laneige, but you're right in that it doesn't really set my makeup lol

For what it's worth, I've heard dry-skin influencers say good things about the Decorte. And the Decorte has micro-shimmers in it that should give your skin more of a glow, which I assume should make it look less dry overall.

You can also use a setting spray to make the powder look less dry and also help your makeup last longer.",tried decorte one laneige one feels really dry skin even height summer asia control oil sweat pretty well though throughout day initial application first hours make skin feel like powdered chalk canmake marshmallow powder comparison feels like body silkiness skin compared laneige right really set makeup lol worth heard dry skin influencers say good things decorte decorte micro shimmers give skin glow assume make look less dry overall also use setting spray make powder look less dry also help makeup last longer

1jwim9d,Decorte vs Laneige Neo Loose Powder for dry skin,Laneige,AsianBeauty,"I have only tried the Laneige one and it has pretty much replaced my previous setting powders. I really like it for achieving a blurred, soft matte base finish. I love that the loose powder is so finely milled, comes in a portable + refillable compact, sets my combo skin without drying any patches out, and lasts through the humidity/rain in my experience! A brief note on the packaging - since the powder comes out through small perforations, if you just press the puff into it, it has a tendency to deposit in little dots on the face, so I suggest swirling the puff around in the compact before applying or using a brush to even out application afterwards. 

Every time I use it, I‚Äôm in awe at the blur factor and how smooth it makes my skin feel. I can use it on my dry under eyes and it helps to prevent my concealer from creasing the best (even compared to a beloved-by-many sublime undereye powder). It also prevents my makeup from transferring to my glasses nose pads when I wear them. Absolutely sorcery ‚ú®",tried laneige one pretty much replaced previous setting powders really like achieving blurred soft matte base finish love loose powder finely milled comes portable refillable compact sets combo skin without drying patches lasts humidity rain experience brief note packaging since powder comes small perforations press puff tendency deposit little dots face suggest swirling puff around compact applying using brush even application afterwards every time use awe blur factor smooth makes skin feel use dry eyes helps prevent concealer creasing best even compared beloved many sublime undereye powder also prevents makeup transferring glasses nose pads wear absolutely sorcery

16xkmki,[Product Question] Sulwhasoo Gentle Cleansing Foam,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"I'm not really a fan of foaming facial cleansers but there is a way of using them.
You have to really foam up the cleanser in the palm of your hands (or foaming net but I prefer hands because it's more hygienic) and apply the foam gently all over your face for approximately 60 seconds or so and rinse off thoroughly. 
There's even a paper written on how to properly use cleansing foams especially the ones that have potassium hydroxide as the main cleansing agent, which this doesn't have but still foams up.

ucbme1,[Review] Sulwhasoo Bloomstay Vitalizing Line,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"Skin type: dry and sensitive

Age: 19

Location: London + Seoul

(I painted over the reflection cause you can see my face and dirty room hehe)

I've been using this line for around 7-8 months now and I also use Sulwhasoo first care activating perfecting serum alongside the line. I also finish up with a Cell Fusion C sunscreen SPF 50+ for sensitive skin and reapply with the UV defense me SPF 50+ sun stick.

This isn't my first time trying a sulwhasoo line, however, this is my favorite line.  My initial thoughts with this line were that first, it smelled AMAZING - it has a very fruity and floral scent to all the products. My boyfriend at that time commented on the scent and asked if I was wearing a new perfume. So if you're not a fan of scented skincare this definitely isn't for you.

Secondly, I found that in the first month or so I was left with more acne on my forehead area but after the month passed it all vanished, and I had a visibly hydrated face, less scarring, and a brighter complexion.

Thirdly, the serum is quite sticky but absorbs really well. The toner is the best product here imo, it's a really nice conditioner and left my skin plumpy BUT left my fingers kinda oily. The moisturizer + eye cream were great, but they didn't really do much for my skin except for hydrating and smoothing the skin. I feel like for the price you're paying, you're able to get a different moisturizer and eye cream for the same results with a cheaper product/line.

Overall I can say that I definitely see less scarring, less acne, fewer wrinkles, a brighter complexion, and I'm left with a well-moisturized face. I don't really think the line contributed much to the decrease of hyperpigmentation on my face, I think the sunscreen helped with that.

If you're not a fan of scented skincare and have oily skin you shouldn't get this line.

onk6j7,[REVIEW] Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"*I purchased all of the products myself and was in no way sponsored.*      

* ***Skin-Type:*** *Combination/oily, South Asian, Fitzpatrick III/IV, acne prone only under facial hair*               
* ***Skin Concerns:*** *Anti-ageing and some anti-acne requirements*                                                                 
* ***Time Period:*** *I first purchased about three years ago and have been using on and off. Current 120ml bottle bought in Mar 21and used regularly since (except for June)*

**Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum**

I think this product wins the record for being the one that spent longest in my basket and wishlists! It's one of those holy grail products with an ""ouch"" price tag but I'm glad I finally took the plunge.                                                        

***Packaging***: I first used a sample, in a very cute, tiny plastic bottle with a pump dispenser, so was pleasantly surprised to feel the real thing. A beautiful thick glass bottle, which runs from opaque white to clear just at the bottom 2-3cm, allowing you to see when you are about to run out. The pump itself is a pretty gold metal, and about 2 pumps is enough for my face and neck.                                                                                                                                    

***Product Feel and Smell:*** A beautiful, burnt liquid gold with a beautiful ginseng smell. Many of the promo materials (and the insert in the box also) recommend taking a few pumps, rubbing in your hands and cupping them to take a deep smell. This is skincare to savour, and with that price, I WILL SAVOUR EVERY SENSATION! You then pat into the skin. It has a serum texture, so won't run off your hands, but it isn't sticky or tacky. I find it melts into the skin pretty seamlessly.                                                                                                                                  

***Does It Work?*** It took me a while to figure out what it is meant to do! The promo material on the website makes a lot of claims - more resilient, firmer skin, smoother skin texture, anti-ageing etc. Most of the reviews I had read talked about a healthy inner glow, more resilient skin. I probably agree with the reviews - it's hard to put your finger on exactly what has changed, and whether it's skin texture or firmness etc. But my skin loves it! I think it may be too early to say whether it is anti-ageing or firming for me, but my skin feels firmer, it looks healthier and I can always see the change in my skin when not using it for a few days.                     

***Positives:*** Beautiful packaging, quick results, pleasant to use, works well with all my other products                                                                                                                                                  

***Negatives:*** The price!

***Overall Opinion:*** I can understand why this is such a popular product, even at that price! I do find I keep buying it, but thankfully I can usually find a sale and a little goes a long way. It's not quite HG status for me yet, but it is certainly upper tier! I will be trying some alternatives to see if I can find a more affordable alternative (I'm going to try the Missha Misa Geum) but for the results so far, I will happily keep repurchasing :)",purchased products way sponsored skin type combination oily south asian fitzpatrick iii iv acne prone facial hair skin concerns anti ageing anti acne requirements time period first purchased three years ago using current ml bottle bought mar used regularly since except june sulwhasoo first care activating serum think product wins record one spent longest basket wishlists one holy grail products ouch price tag glad finally took plunge packaging first used sample cute tiny plastic bottle pump dispenser pleasantly surprised feel real thing beautiful thick glass bottle runs opaque white clear bottom cm allowing see run pump pretty gold metal pumps enough face neck product feel smell beautiful burnt liquid gold beautiful ginseng smell many promo materials insert box also recommend taking pumps rubbing hands cupping take deep smell skincare savour price savour every sensation pat skin serum texture run hands sticky tacky find melts skin pretty seamlessly work took figure meant promo material website makes lot claims resilient firmer skin smoother skin texture anti ageing etc reviews read talked healthy inner glow resilient skin probably agree reviews hard put finger exactly changed whether skin texture firmness etc skin loves think may early say whether anti ageing firming skin feels firmer looks healthier always see change skin using days positives beautiful packaging quick results pleasant use works well products negatives price overall opinion understand popular product even price find keep buying thankfully usually find sale little goes long way quite hg status yet certainly upper tier trying alternatives see find affordable alternative going try missha misa geum results far happily keep repurchasing

The LJH oil cleanser is mineral oil based, no? I noticed that you mention how meticulous you have to be using a second cleanser to back that oil cleanser up off your skin. 

I was testing the Illi total aging oil cleanser, which is also mineral oil based. It gave me my not-acne-prone dry skin a pretty deep whitehead, along with a couple baby whiteheads on my chin. I figured this occurred due to maybe not cleansing well enough to remove the mineral oil. But despite even using my Hada Labo pump or CosRX good morning cleansers with a Konjac sponge, and really being thorough on cleansing + rinsing, I still broke out. 

The Illi cleansing oil is nice as it did really allows me to do a massage and it gets some crap out of my face. So I would like to keep it in my wardrobe to use every 1-2 weeks. I too have MRCS... Perhaps I should use that to cleanse?

fthltb,[Review] Sulwhasoo concentrated ginseng renewing eye cream ex first impressions,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"*mini ramble* I'm stuck indoors for quite a while and that meant some online shopping. Unfortunately for me I'm in Canada so a lot of stores aren't offering their usual shipping services to us anymore. I was ready to just spend more for shipping until I realized that some stores ~coughtesterkoreacough~ doesn't actually keep any merchandise on hand and only orders it from the actual brands after I place my order, so now I have stuff that I ordered 3 weeks ago that has yet to leave the warehouse (what is even the point of expedited shipping). Luckily dodoskin pulled through and I managed to receive my eye cream (sephora Canada does have it too, but they mark up Korean products to hell and back so I'd rather just get it through a store based in Korea, if you want to order something too it might be a good idea to check out the ebay store to compare prices). Please be careful when you're ordering and try to stick with stores you trust, everyone. Have more patience during this time and stay safe.

Anyway, on to my actual first impressions.

The last luxury Asian eye cream I tried was the shiseido benefiance from quite a while ago. I was pretty interested in sulwhasoo but really didn't like the scent of their ginseng overnight mask. Thankfully the eye creams scent is less over powering. They do try pretty hard to make it smell like ginseng but it doesn't quite hit the mark. So what you end up with is a rather generic herbal smell that fades after a few minutes. The packaging is lovely (and sturdy, unlike the history of whoo which just feels like cheap plastic), although it comes with a rather flimsy little spatula that I don't think I'm going to use. I dislike thick balmy creams like the Dr jart ceramidin and thin emulsions just don't feel like enough for the under eye. This one strikes a nice balance of being thick yet spreadable. Fun fact, my package managed to make all the way from Korea without the cream being sloshed around on the inside if that gives an idea of how stiff it is. It leaves the skin glossy and a bit sticky (and the stickiness is still noticeable in the morning). I'm fine with it not really sinking in since it's an eye cream after all. Overall I'm not getting wowed (which is a shame at that price), but I'm not expecting miracles out of a cream, it does feel quite nice and I'm definitely not going to stop using it.",mini ramble stuck indoors quite meant online shopping unfortunately canada lot stores offering usual shipping services us anymore ready spend shipping realized stores coughtesterkoreacough actually keep merchandise hand orders actual brands place order stuff ordered weeks ago yet leave warehouse even point expedited shipping luckily dodoskin pulled managed receive eye cream sephora canada mark korean products hell back rather get store based korea want order something might good idea check ebay store compare prices please careful ordering try stick stores trust everyone patience time stay safe anyway actual first impressions last luxury asian eye cream tried shiseido benefiance quite ago pretty interested sulwhasoo really like scent ginseng overnight mask thankfully eye creams scent less powering try pretty hard make smell like ginseng quite hit mark end rather generic herbal smell fades minutes packaging lovely sturdy unlike history whoo feels like cheap plastic although comes rather flimsy little spatula think going use dislike thick balmy creams like dr jart ceramidin thin emulsions feel like enough eye one strikes nice balance thick yet spreadable fun fact package managed make way korea without cream sloshed around inside gives idea stiff leaves skin glossy bit sticky stickiness still noticeable morning fine really sinking since eye cream overall getting wowed shame price expecting miracles cream feel quite nice definitely going stop using

4lcn18,Review: Sulwhasoo Evenfair Perfecting Cushion,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"This review was an adventure for me. Why? Well, because I‚Äôve been using the same foundation for the past year ‚Äì the Tarte BB cream I posted a review of a few months ago ‚Äì and was frankly very reluctant to try anything else. However, I was running low on the BB cream and had a few things I was dissatisfied with about it (mainly that the closest color to my skin tone was still a subpar match), so I figured maybe it was time to try something new! I scoured the AB subreddit and some blogs looking for the yellowest-toned Korean cushions I could find, and this one emerged as the winner. Better yet, Nordstrom carried it and has free shipping, so I figured why not?

**Product Description:** A liquid-foundation-soaked sponge in a compact case with an included applicator, the material of which is quite similar to a Beauty Blender. The product comes with a refill sponge as well.

Unfortunately, since the closest Nordstrom is like a day‚Äôs drive away, I had to guess at the correct color rather than getting to swatch the product first. Luckily(?), there were only three shades to choose from: one that was clearly too pink, and two strangely near-identical ones that were a little darker. Of the latter, I chose #23, as #25 was a little darker but also looked more beige than yellow. From the swatches I could find online, it looked like it would be a pretty good match for me, so I wasn‚Äôt too worried.

My initial impression of the cushion was actually very good. The first thing I was surprised by is that it applies very easily. I was a little suspicious of having to apply my foundation with a flat sponge/puff, but the formula was really easy to work with and I was able to get an even base layer down in probably under a minute. Given the other reviews I‚Äôd read and the type of product, I was surprised both at how relatively heavy the coverage was, and how matte the finish. I‚Äôd been expecting something more on the dewy end of things, but this was somewhere between totally matte and satin. Maybe that was just because the air is so dry where I live, I dunno.

A word of warning to my readers: this product, at least on me, looks much lighter on skin than it does in the compact. I‚Äôm pretty fair-skinned despite being mixed-race, and had actually expected it to possibly be too dark for me, but far from it. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the high SPF or what, but with it on my face was markedly paler than my neck. I was able to more or less hide this with some creative usage of bronzer, but still, just a heads up.

Even though I prefer a satin or dewy finish, I actually liked how the product looked when first applied. However, within a couple hours, I remembered why matte foundations just don‚Äôt work for me. I had checked the ingredients list to make sure this would be compatible with my primer/serum, but even though it was, it definitely started to break up around my nose by mid-afternoon. I tried using powder over the top on the second day I used this, which helped a little, but it was still a problem. The rest of the foundation actually wore pretty well, other than clinging a little to dry patches. And, another bonus, I‚Äôm now on day three of using the product and it has yet to break me out at all; in fact, my skin usually looks pretty nice when I take it off in the evening. I can‚Äôt speak to the purported anti-aging properties of some of the ingredients, but this felt a lot gentler and nicer to my skin than any other medium-to-full coverage foundation I‚Äôve tried.

**Overall:** This cushion definitely has some great points. It applies well, it has surprisingly good coverage (assuming that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for), it seems to be okay for sensitive or clog-prone skin, and it wears pretty nicely throughout the day. However, it definitely isn‚Äôt for me. Not only is the shade range very limited, to the point where I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a close enough match for me or many other people, but the finish is too matte for what I‚Äôm looking for. I really wanted to make it work, because I hate returning high-end products, but in this case I think I actually might considering the cost ($60 for the product and included refill).

**Review: 2.5/5**

2: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a big fan of the product, but I‚Äôll probably use it once in a while‚Äù

4lcn18,Review: Sulwhasoo Evenfair Perfecting Cushion,Sulwhasoo,AsianBeauty,"Thanks for this thorough review! As someone with a mixed race background with both pink and yellow in my very pale skin, I have a surprisingly hard time finding a decent foundation match of any kind. Right now I'm mixing 1:1 of Mac Studio Line NC-15 and NW-13, which is as close to perfect as I've gotten. Unfortunately mixing foundation in the morning means I can't touch up during the day, so I'd like to have a cushion to carry in my bag to do that. And I do like fuller coverage and matte works well for me. Do you know what Mac shade range you are? I know you said the #23 was too light for you, but I'm thinking it might work for me. 

Also, one last question...any noticeable scent to this? I'm really sensitive to smells and have a hard time with anything too perfumy. I love the fresh gingery smell of Sulwahsoo's Overnight Vitalizing Mask, but I have a powder compact of theirs and it's too perfumy for me to use.

I've tried multiple items from Sulwhasoo including the FCAS, Overnight Vitalizing Mask, Essential line, and the Concentrated Ginseng line. I like and continue to repurchase and use some of the items, but definitely not all. As with all skincare, YMMV and it really depends on how your skin reacts, your skincare goals, and your budget. I highly recommend for all skincare to purchase a sample or trial size, if possible, and test it for a few weeks before splurging on larger sizes. Sulwhasoo is also more reasonably priced if you order in/from Asian countries.

Regarding the Concentrated Ginseng Cream specifically, it's better for those with dry/normal skin or when you want something thicker. There is a strong ginseng scent, which I personally enjoy, but may not be for everyone. There is  a Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream and Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream Classic. The classic is closer to the original one, with a strong ginseng scent and slightly thicker texture.

Doesn't feel tacky and most importantly moisturizes pretty well. I've used it as a standalone moisturizer as well and it wasn't too bad. FA safe ingredients. Gives a nice glow the next day. Though it's marketed as a hyaluronic acid sleeping mask, I suspect the beta glucan does the heavy lifting. I used it as a moisturizer mostly, nowadays as a sleeping mask though. Totally useless on extra dry weather days though, I'll blame the Hyaluronic Acid for that.

**Benton Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel**

2/5 WNRP

I don't like gels but there's also something about *soothing gels* that's just very appealing to me. It does soothe but not enough for my dry skin, not even close. Doesn't even add much as the third step in a four step routine. Made my face a weird gray shade too. It's a cool gel texture that absorbs nicely, I'll give it that. No fragrance. 

**Purito Cica Dermide Sleeping Pack** (old packaging)

2.5/5 WNRP

It's a very runny lotion. Super lightweight, calming but super shiny too. The formulation might be great for oily or combination skin but the shine is unbearable. Bit more moisturizing than the Benton soothing gel. I used to use it on irritated skin and it did a job. But I wanted something more moisturizing and less shiny thank you very much. No fragrance. 

**Sulwhasoo Overnight Revitalizing Mask**

4.8/5 MRP

It is a thick cream, quite moisturizing as it has shea butter but not quite enough as a standalone moisturizer. Works perfectly with layers though. Loved using it in the winter as the final layer after moisturizer. It has a very nice hanbang smell. The smell and texture made it feel like a treat at the end of my routine ngl. Will advise caution if you are particularly sensitive though it has a long list of potentially irritating ingredients. Didn't break me out normally until recently. Nowadays my skin feels extra sensitive so things that normally work aren't working very well. 

**Cur√©l Facial Moisture Cream**

1/5 WNRP

Absolutely not a fan. It has a nice whipped texture but makes my face feel waxy. Just kinda sits on top of my face and barely moisturizes. It didn't play well with my face either. After about 1/3^rd I gave up and used up on my body. Didn't take long lol it comes in a 40g jar. 

**Mizon All in One Snail Repair Cream**

4.8/5 WRP

I am in love. It's a sticky snail texture similar to Cosrx AIO cream but more moisturizing. Takes a minute to absorb. It's not enough as a standalone moisturizer for my dry skin but I reckon it will be fine if you're not too dry. I use it as a kind of a 1st moisturizer. But what I love about it is its healing. Healed my wrecked skin in less than a week to a more respectable state. It's not fully healed yet but I don't hate myself anymore. I love snail and it's a lot less sticky than the Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence and more potent than the Neogen Cica Snail Repair Essence. Win win. Found it for $12 at a TJMaxx which makes it even sweeter lol. 

**Dr Ceuracle Vegan Kombucha Tea Gel Cream**

4.5/ may not repurchase 

It's a cool (literally) gel cream that's more gel than cream. Very hydrating and soothing, works ok outside of winter. I think most people will find it enough, that is if you're not extra dry. It gives a glow like the essence but the essence is better imo. In fact using both is an overkill. If you have an elaborate routine I would suggest the essence (my HG) but if you can't be bothered too much go for the gel cream. I will probably not get this again because of the price and the essence being sufficient. It's overall a good moisturizer that doesn't bother my skin. No fragrance. 

**Mary&May Idebenone Blackberry Intense Cream**

4.6/5 WNRP 

It has a unique pudding texture, not too heavy, slightly oily but the most moisturizing of this lot. It would be the perfect winter moisturizer for me if wasn't crazy brightening. Fr, too much. Though now at the end of spring I find it leaves me a lil oily in the morning so it's strictly for winter time use. I really wish I could keep it but not a fan of an overly bright face that just looks wrong sitting on top of my neck.  Acne prone people might want to check out the ingredients list before commiting.

The now discontinued Timetreasure serums in sample packets were definitely worth $7-9 for twelve samples. Would I buy the $200+ full size? Unlikely at that price but a former sub member suggested using a sample sachet instead of a sheet mask and it worked perfectly in that context.

For hormonal breakouts, I‚Äôd get pimple patches and a spot treatment (always preferred one with salicylic acid myself). And tbh, a benzoyl peroxide cleanser. You can start off low, 5%, and a few times a week. You might also consider upping your retinoid to more frequently than 3x week.

add4e5,[Review] Etude House Soon Jung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for a good pH balanced cleanser since September! Back in August I posted a FOTD here and got some comments asking about the cleanser I was using then: Muji Face Soap Scrub. I praised it, and then a week later learned about the effects of high pH cleansers on skin. *Oops*.

**Etude House‚Äôs Soonjung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser has a pH** of... you guessed it, 6.5. üòâ So it‚Äôs **slightly acidic**. I actually never found out what the pH of the Muji one was but looking at the ingredients list, it‚Äôs 99% similar to 99% of foam cleansers out there. So I‚Äôm assuming like 8-9.

It‚Äôs **ingredients** list is [here](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_30e5291449.html). Clean ingredients, formulated for sensitive skin, like the rest of Etude House‚Äôs Soonjung line. *heart eyes* Panthenol and Madecassoside supposedly have skin-calming effects. This cleanser hasn‚Äôt irritated my skin (Unlike *Cosrx*) but my skin isn‚Äôt exactly the most irritated to begin with.

The **texture** of the cleanser is a [light foam](https://imgur.com/a/TgrW7hI). It comes with a foam pump. I use 2 pumps every morning and night. Right now I‚Äôve purchased the 70 mL size, and it‚Äôs half full. So according to math, the full size 150 mL will last approx 2.5 months with 2 pumps twice a day.

Some users have said that it **smells** like plastic. IMO it smells pretty similar to the Muji cleansers, because it‚Äôs unscented. However, it‚Äôs a really light chemical-plastic smell and I don‚Äôt really notice it.

Is it **drying? No.** I found Cosrx drying, and my skin survived 2 hours without toner/anything moisturizing. So it passed it dry-test. Ymmw, everyone‚Äôs skin is different. My skin type is normal to dry (Bless Canadian Winters!!)

Would I **repurchase**? Maybe. I still have an unopened bottle of Hada Labo Foam Cleanser to try. Whichever works better, I‚Äôll repurchase. That being said, I got this from rubyrubyshop.com. The travel ver is $7.32 USD and the full ver is $10.90 USD. Shipping prices are included in the price. All you have to do is pay $2.11 USD for a tracking number. Came in 3 weeks.

**Overall** this is a good second cleanser for sensitive skin (My skin‚Äôs been irritated by many sheet masks and Cosrx products). It has pretty good **cleansing power,** I tried it on gel eyeliner, glittery eyeshadow and it came straight off. Will sting eyes though.

Price: 5/5

anz723,[Review] Etude House Soonjung Gel & Innisfree Ato Soothing Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"Products:

\- Etude House Soon Jung Moist Relief All In One Gel

\- Innisfree Ato Soothing Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++

Hello! Two weeks ago, these products arrived and now I'm here to share my thoughts on these with you all. :D For background, my skin type is normal to dry, and my skin tone is a fenty 160, so approx mac nc 20? missha 23.

Starting with the Soonjung gel, I purchased this because I was looking for a lightweight gel moisturizer and because it has very simple ingredients. (Cosdna) (Skincarisma)

It is: Alcohol, silicone, and paraben free! As a bonus, it is EU allergen free, and safe for fungal acne!

My original plan was to use this as a light daytime moisturizer. Unfortunately, it isn't very moisturizing. I would say it has more of a toner feel as it very quickly dissolves into water, and sinks into your skin. I've been using it after my toner steps (kiku + HL premium), and before sunscreen or sleeping mask.

It's not a terrible product, but isn't anything spectacular either. It's very cool when first applied to the skin, and feels nice on my skin in the morning. It has pantenol, elm extract, green tea extract, and ivy extract.

One thing that bothers me about this product is the packaging! The hole in front of the tube is way too large and it can be hard to dispense the right amount without going over.

Moisturizing level: 3/5

Packaging: 2/5

Affordability: 4/5 ($10.47 USD on rubyrubyshop for 120 mL)

Repurchase: No. It doesn't do anything my toners do, and I have two more moisturizers already on the way to test out (Tonymoly green tea chok chok cream and Rosette ceramide gel)

&#x200B;

Next, my first AB sunscreen: Innisfree Ato Soothing Sun Stick SPF 50+ PA++++

I went through a dehydrated and irritated phase for my skin so I wasn't wearing sunscreen because most of them were burning my face! Previously I had used Neutrogena Baby Sunscreen only on mid-high UV days (i know, i know) and didn't really enjoy it after my skin decided to dry out.

I chose to try the innisfree ato sun stick because it has no silicones or alcohols, which is a rarity for sunscreens! I know my skin will burn if alcohol is at the top of the ingredients list. D:

This sunscreen has no glaringly terrible ingredients. (Cosdna) (Skincarisma)

It is paraben free, alcohol free, silicone free. Not FA safe. :C

Before I bought it I honestly have not been able to find a single review about this product!! So I was totally in the dark about how this would preform. Luckily, it does NOT leave a white cast, but you will have to blend the product into your skin vigorously. There is a slight brightening effect (uhh very minimal white cast?) and the sunscreen has a velvety, glowy finish. The first day I wore it my friend said my skin was glowing lol.

The one thing that bothered me the most about this sun stick is that it. does. not. freaking. sink. into. your. skin. EVER. I can't touch my face throughout the day because there will be some residue on my fingers. D:  I don't know if this is just some extra residue or if it is the actual sunscreen coming off. I did find a video where a lady swatched it and held it under a UV light to show that it did WORK to deflect UV rays, and when she rubbed the sunscreen it was still on her skin. So hopefully, it's just some extra residue that doesn't affect the performance of the sunscreen. Maybe you need to use some makeup setting spray or powder with this. Idk I think that's ridiculous.

This sunscreen didn't break my skin out, and didn't feel greasy. The only con was that it never sinks in. :C

Moisturizing: didn't dry me out, was slightly moisturizing. Def still need a moisturizer under this. 3/5

Packaging: 5/5 it's gorgeous T\_T;; Stick glides well and is easy to apply.

Affordability: 3/5. I got this for $13.45 USD on rubyrubyshop. It's not too easy to find elsewhere, esp. amazon or in store shops. :/

Repurchase: No. I've decided to try innisfree daily uv protection essence sensitive SPF 50+ PA++++ and innisfree aqua uv protection cream mineral filter SPF 48 PA+++ next!

If I layered it too much on my skin, it left some powder residue when it dried down which I think is the silica that's listed on the ingredients. I think it's best suited for oily skin types. I have dry skin that gets dehydrated easily and it actually made it feel more dry and tight when I used it for a few days in a row.

*background info:*  
this sunscreen is actually a 2022 renewal/reformulation of etude house's [Sunprise Mild Watery Light SPF 50+ PA+++](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/smtblt/2022_renewal_for_etude_sunprise_mild_watery_light/hw8j78w/?context=3), which was my holy grail, and I still regret not stocking up before they discontinued it - I even still have one corpse/empty bottle of it, I loved it that much. naturally my heart broke a little when I saw this new version on yesstyle lol but I ordered one and here we are - I was still excited to try it out, especially since my expectations are so high bc of it being the replacement to my all-time holy grail sunscreen </3 I loved the texture & finish of the old one; as someone with combo-oily skin it made me look dewy in such a healthy, non-oily way, and that's ultimately what I was looking for the most in this renewed version - that healthy glow that was unique to the Sunprise. the old version did have fragrance, which wasn't for everyone but it was light & citrus-y in a sugary lemon candy kinda way so i personally enjoyed it as I'm not sensitive to fragrance and actually prefer it in a sunscreen that I'm applying everyday when I start my morning to cheer me up. this new version, while not fragrance-free, seems to have improved on the other shortcomings of the Sunprise - it's PA++++ instead of PA+++ like the old version was and has gotten rid of the essential oils. it also contains vitamin c in the form of ascorbic acid, but it's pretty low on the ingredient list so the effects wouldn't be anything dramatic - but what with the whole vitamin c + sunscreen synergy effect having these two in one product might go a long way in the long term?

so the question is, is this sunscreen good enough to become my long-searched for (after the discontinuation of the Sunprise) holy grail?

*review:*  
this sunscreen is extremely hydrating, which I definitely appreciate as someone with dehydrated skin - it lives up to the ""Aqua"" in its name for sure, and is hydrating enough for me and my combo skin to use it on its own as my morning skincare routine. it's as hydrating as the Biore but less moisturizing and rich. the texture is also one of the most lightweight of any SPF i've tried, hand-in-hand with the Klairs, and it goes on like a dream - it spreads as smooth as butter but without the heaviness or greasiness, and also sits beautifully under base makeup (although I personally stick to lightweight skin tints as foundation when i do wear it instead of going foundation-free with just concealer, so please keep that in mind) with no pilling, clinging to dry patches, or flaking. it also has no white cast on me, however I'm quite pale (shade 1.5 in the Saem Cover Perfection Tip Concealer) so I unfortunately can't say whether that holds up for deeper skin tones. the fragrance is very light, a refreshing, aqua-y kinda scent that I can only describe as smelling like hotel rooms, and fades a few seconds after application. in terms of the vitamin c, as someone with a lot of hyperpigmentation, I haven't noticed much of a change from this product, which isn't unexpected bc of how low it is on the ingredient list but again, the vitamin c + sunscreen effect in one product might end up being beneficial long term. because of its texture, ease of application and deep hydration it makes for a great everyday sunscreen, which I can see working for spring and autumn especially but easily for summer or winter as well depending on what kind of finish you prefer. its ability to be so hydrating while being so lightweight makes it incredibly versatile imo.

the make-or-break factor here for me was, like I mentioned, whether this reformulation would give me the same unique, healthy, dewy finish that had made me fall in love with the Sunprise; dewy, glass skin without ever looking oily - because YES, there is a difference (anyone who says otherwise is lying to you and to themselves). I have combo-oily skin but the more glow the better for me (yes we exist), and the distinction between glass skin and deep fryer is especially important for me as someone who loves a dewy look - and the old version handled that distinction so elegantly. and, this version, I'm relieved to say, handles it the exact same way. it was like falling in love all over again. in fact, I'm about to RP once it comes back into stock on stylevana. also, it wears so gracefully throughout the day (another factor I loved in the old version) - when my natural oils inevitably come in they seem to mix in slightly with the dewy finish in a way that only naturally enhances the glass skin effect without taking it over the edge into deep fryer territory... trust me, it looks a lot better than I'm describing it rn.

however, as much as I love it, there was one con to this sunscreen that will probably be the make-or-break factor for someone else: it did sting my eyes on occasion </3 only for a few occasions, and randomly too, as I wore only this everyday for a month and it happened 2 or 3 times when my eyes were slightly more sensitive after putting in contact lenses. because of how much this sunscreen ticks every other box, it's not a dealbreaker for me as I'll still RP, but if you're worried about this and/or have very sensitive eyes this is probably not the one for you.",skin type combination leaning oily dehydrated prone pih location australia low humidity obviously high uv levels personally look sunscreen high spf pa rankings bc australia really afford compromise sun protection white cast dewy finish chemical uv filters sunscreens tried etude house sunprise mild watery light spf pa biore uv aqua rich essence spf pa dear klairs soft airy uv essence spf pa cosrx aloe soothing sun cream spf pa background info sunscreen actually renewal reformulation etude house sunprise mild watery light spf pa holy grail still regret stocking discontinued even still one corpse empty bottle loved much naturally heart broke little saw new version yesstyle lol ordered one still excited try especially since expectations high bc replacement time holy grail sunscreen loved texture finish old one someone combo oily skin made look dewy healthy non oily way ultimately looking renewed version healthy glow unique sunprise old version fragrance everyone light citrus sugary lemon candy kinda way personally enjoyed sensitive fragrance actually prefer sunscreen applying everyday start morning cheer new version fragrance free seems improved shortcomings sunprise pa instead pa like old version gotten rid essential oils also contains vitamin c form ascorbic acid pretty low ingredient list effects anything dramatic whole vitamin c sunscreen synergy effect two one product might go long way long term question sunscreen good enough become long searched discontinuation sunprise holy grail review sunscreen extremely hydrating definitely appreciate someone dehydrated skin lives aqua name sure hydrating enough combo skin use morning skincare routine hydrating biore less moisturizing rich texture also one lightweight spf tried hand hand klairs goes like dream spreads smooth butter without heaviness greasiness also sits beautifully base makeup although personally stick lightweight skin tints foundation wear instead going foundation free concealer please keep mind pilling clinging dry patches flaking also white cast however quite pale shade saem cover perfection tip concealer unfortunately say whether holds deeper skin tones fragrance light refreshing aqua kinda scent describe smelling like hotel rooms fades seconds application terms vitamin c someone lot hyperpigmentation noticed much change product unexpected bc low ingredient list vitamin c sunscreen effect one product might end beneficial long term texture ease application deep hydration makes great everyday sunscreen see working spring autumn especially easily summer winter well depending kind finish prefer ability hydrating lightweight makes incredibly versatile imo make break factor like mentioned whether reformulation would give unique healthy dewy finish made fall love sunprise dewy glass skin without ever looking oily yes difference anyone says otherwise lying combo oily skin glow better yes exist distinction glass skin deep fryer especially important someone loves dewy look old version handled distinction elegantly version relieved say handles exact way like falling love fact rp comes back stock stylevana also wears gracefully throughout day another factor loved old version natural oils inevitably come seem mix slightly dewy finish way naturally enhances glass skin effect without taking edge deep fryer territory trust looks lot better describing rn however much love one con sunscreen probably make break factor someone else sting eyes occasion occasions randomly wore everyday month happened times eyes slightly sensitive putting contact lenses much sunscreen ticks every box dealbreaker still rp worried sensitive eyes probably one

av6nvr,[Review] Etude House Soon Jung Cica Balm,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"**Etude House Soonjung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm**

&#x200B;

**Ingredients:** Water, Propanediol, Panthenol, Squalane, Cetearyl Alcohol, Madecassoside, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Butylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Glyceryl Stearate, Diisostearyl Malate, Cetearyl Glucoside, Stearic Acid, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Tromethamine, Polyglyceryl-10 Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Disodium EDTA, 1,2-Hexanediol

&#x200B;

**Description:** (from rubyrubyshop) 

Cica Balm for the improvement of damaged skin with 5% Panthensoside.  
Low-irritant Cica balm improves damaged skin caused by external stress.  
and irritation by improving skin's protein and by protecting skin barrier.

**How to use:** Apply on areas that need soothing effect or all over the entire face.  
For intensive care, apply a liberal amount.  


**My skin type:** dry and very sensitive (reacts badly to some plant extracts, denatured alcohol, and essential oils)

>Since my skin has been irritated and very dry recently, I decided to try out this cica balm to see if it would help with my problematic skin. I bought this in store at M Brand Shop in Toronto for $13 CAD, but it can be found online for much less. The one I have is the 15 mL size. On the left, is its current state after two weeks of use. On the right, is when it was plump and brand new. :(

&#x200B;

It is a **moderately moisturizing** cream that does not break me out. 

>On a scale of hydration I would give it a 7/10. 

It is quite thick when it is coming out of the tube, but will settle into your skin in around 10-20 minutes.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I **did not notice that it helped heal my pimples** faster than they normally do. It was decent at **calming** itchy and inflamed skin. It didn't do anything bad, but it was not a miracle cream for pimples and redness.

>Pimple-healing ability: 0/10 :(  
>  
>Calming ability: 5/10 (maybe because I also use the Soonjung gel and cleanser that my skin has developed tolerance to madecassoside? :/ )

&#x200B;

Overall, I think it is a **good moisturizer for dry, sensitive skin**. However, it alone is not enough to prevent my skin from flaking throughout the day. I use 3 layers of toner before it to ensure my skin is properly hydrated.

&#x200B;

**Would I repurchase? No.** I am currently testing another moisturizer (Missha Near Skin Total Ceramide Cream) and already have the soonjung gel & cleanser for their madecassoside properties. If I really wanted more madecassoside in my routine, I would buy the toner.

&#x200B;

**Cons of the product: The Cica Balm pills on your skin.** So it is not suitable for makeup wearers. It is hard to layer over and under other products as well. Additionally, it has a thick texture that may be too much for oily skin.

&#x200B;

**Where can you buy it?** Almost everywhere! I believe the lowest price is the rubyrubyshop website. ($12.78 USD for 40 mL + free shipping)

The colors are not pigmented, and the first shade doesn‚Äôt show up on my skin tone at all other than adding a little shimmer. The browns are very light compared to what‚Äôs shown on the pan as well.

62znj7,[Review] Mini review: Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy Finish,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"Ive been using this for almost a month now and I have to agree with a lot of your points. On application, I actually like it than all of my biore sunscreens combined because the lack of alcohol felt gentler, but I've noticed that the EH was a lot more oil-controlling and mattifying than the biore. It looks lovely under makeup especially because it helped control my oil but it definitely has a white cast on me (NC20-25 but face is darker than body). In the end though it was so drying on my face and for some reason my face feels mildly itchy the first few hours. Honestly, I hope a massive breakout doesn't happen on my skin.

Advice I can give is that if you think the EH sunscreen is causing some irritation on your skin then stop using it until the irritation calms down then patch test again. Use your old sunscreen until then. I hope Cosrx or Missha works for you!",ive using almost month agree lot points application actually like biore sunscreens combined lack alcohol felt gentler noticed eh lot oil controlling mattifying biore looks lovely makeup especially helped control oil definitely white cast nc face darker body end though drying face reason face feels mildly itchy first hours honestly hope massive breakout happen skin advice give think eh sunscreen causing irritation skin stop using irritation calms patch test use old sunscreen hope cosrx missha works

(Honestly, I do not get why the biore one is so popular... it is drying due to the alcohol, it contains lemon extract (which is very irritating to the skin) and the scent is too strong. My sensitive skin hates it! But I guess that the biore is good compared to US sunscreens (Im from Europe so I am more spoiled with UV filters))

It works to well under make up and it feels like I have applied nothing!!I also love the fact they have a jumbo sizes version of the sungel  Just most chemical filters STING my eyes like hell.

acmxy1,[REVIEW] Etude House - Hot Style Bubble Hair Coloring,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"I think the khaki brown or natural brown shade might have been a better match for your original colour.

As someone who has been dying her hair twice a year for over a decade because my first grays started at 24, I'd like to mention that I really prefer AB bubble hair colors to western dyes. 

Western brands don't have the bubble option which makes for much easier time when you do it by yourself and less mess, plus there's less of a chance you miss entire locks. Also, AB dyes have fragrance that covers the chemical smell so one doesn't get lightheaded in one's bathroom when doing the dye. It often is rather sickly sweet but I'd rather smell obvious fragrance that the chemical smell. Plus AB dyes often have absolutely everything included  like a plastic poncho to cover your clothes/body so you don't have to cut up a plastic bag.",think khaki brown natural brown shade might better match original colour someone dying hair twice year decade first grays started like mention really prefer ab bubble hair colors western dyes western brands bubble option makes much easier time less mess plus less chance miss entire locks also ab dyes fragrance covers chemical smell one get lightheaded one bathroom dye often rather sickly sweet rather smell obvious fragrance chemical smell plus ab dyes often absolutely everything included like plastic poncho cover clothes body cut plastic bag

o7njeu,"[Review & Swatches] Etude House Fixing Tint (all shades, texture, longevity, etc.)",Etude House,AsianBeauty,"Hope everyone‚Äôs staying safe and healthy. :)

I‚Äôve done a review & swatches for the Etude House Fixing Tint line, so I wanted to share it with you all.

There are 5 shades in the line and they‚Äôve been getting lots of attention for their new mask proof/smudge proof formula and pretty shades.

- Texture: When you first apply the tint it glides on smoothly and has a hydrating, creamy texture which you can smudge or move around easily. After 60 seconds or so the tint dries up and becomes matte and set in place. It doesn‚Äôt budge after the ‚Äúfixing‚Äù time. It‚Äôs not powdery or velvety matte, and it leaves a SLIGHTLY sticky feeling on the lips. I don‚Äôt find it drying on the lips given it‚Äôs matte. Etude House calls it the new ‚Äúhydro-matte‚Äù texture. 

- Longevity: These tints last for a very long time, I usually don‚Äôt have to reapply the tint when I go out for at least several hours, unless I drink or eat frequently (especially greasy things).

- Smudge/mask proof: I‚Äôd def say these tints do live up to the claim as ‚Äúmask proof‚Äù. Even after hours of wearing a mask, I see little to no marks left on my mask. However *IMPORTANT* remember to press the lips on a tissue a couple of times before putting on the mask to remove any excess and leave only the right amount of the product on the lips. If you put on a thick coat, you will probably see more smudging/more product coming off. So controlling the amount is crucial in preventing smudging.

- Staining: There‚Äôs a bit of staining left after removal (with a makeup remover), especially with the first 2 darker shades. 

Shades: 

- 01 analog rose: rose red muted slightly with a drop of white
- 02 vintage red: warm coral red with a tinge of cream
- 03 mellow peach: coral peach
- 04 ginger milk tea: nude ginger beige
- 05 midnight mauve: faded rose

All in all, I find myself reaching for these tints very frequently these days, because I love the shades, transfer proof formula and how long they last. My favourite way is to apply a thin coat with blurred edges. 

One downside is that all shades are pretty warm, so I hope Etude House will release some cool toned shades in the future.

I have a full review & lip swatches video [here](https://youtu.be/C3m2oeAJiEo) if you want to see these tints in more detail/worn on the lips in natural lighting.
Let me know if you have any questions. :)

**Make Up - Lips**

**Best**

I received this in my pink bird box  a year or so ago now(their ambassador program) and was surprised that it was not just gimmicky packaging tbh. I do love the ice cream packaging, that it used to be in. Believe they update the packaging each year though, to something just as cute! As with all things Etude House it's very cute, but it's also a decent lip tint. For the price I think it does what you'd want a lip tint to do. Good coverage, easy to apply (I like the soft applicator, it's pliable and easy to maneuver) and doesn't crack. I would say that this does transfer if you've not dried it down. I dry lip tints down by smacking my lips on some oil blotting paper. 

I've had compliments on the colour stain lasting through the day from my work colleagues which is a good endorsement!

One top tip is to ensure you've kept your lips exfoliated, otherwise the stain tends to settle unevenly.",dear darling water gel tint make lips best received pink bird box year ago ambassador program surprised gimmicky packaging tbh love ice cream packaging used believe update packaging year though something cute things etude house cute also decent lip tint price think want lip tint good coverage easy apply like soft applicator pliable easy maneuver crack would say transfer dried dry lip tints smacking lips oil blotting paper compliments colour stain lasting day work colleagues good endorsement one top tip ensure kept lips exfoliated otherwise stain tends settle unevenly

**Product Name:** Drawing Eyebrow Pencil 

**Thoughts:** I have this in the shade #04 Dark Gray (for reference I have jet black hair but wanted something more natural looking). It's your typical double ended retractable brow pencil (has a spoolie on one end). I like that I don't have to sharpen it but the triangle shaped nib is larger than I prefer.

The formula itself is soft, relatively sheer & more on the waxy side. I wish it was harder & more pigmented. The softness does make it very beginner/in-a-rush friendly though. Using a spoolie to blend the product in is a must with a formula like this so it's great that one is included. On my very sweaty brows it lasts about 3 hours unless I set it with a separate brow gel. 

Overall, it's not a bad product especially for it's price (I got for under 3 quid) but isn't a good match for my needs (precise fine nib, pigmented, long lasting & a ""natural"" black shade).",skin type concerns dehydrated combo skin product name drawing eyebrow pencil thoughts shade dark gray reference jet black hair wanted something natural looking typical double ended retractable brow pencil spoolie one end like sharpen triangle shaped nib larger prefer formula soft relatively sheer waxy side wish harder pigmented softness make beginner rush friendly though using spoolie blend product must formula like great one included sweaty brows lasts hours unless set separate brow gel overall bad product especially price got quid good match needs precise fine nib pigmented long lasting natural black shade

**Product Name:** ***Hot Style Bubble Coloring*** *(Hair Color)*

**Thoughts:** I love it! 

I naturally have dark brown hair, and Wine Red gives me red-brown hair that's initially 2-3 shades lighter. It gets maybe a shade darker after a couple of washes and it settles into this nice color that makes my hair look more defined (I'm currently sporting a bob, so definition is everything), like I applied highlights and lowlights when it's really just one color. I think it makes my face look a little brighter, too. 

The best part, I think, about this is that it makes the entire hair coloring process so much easier for me. I don't need a coloring comb/brush nor a mixing bowl. The dye gets poured into a foaming pump bottle that already contains the developer. You swish the bottle around a couple of times and you're ready to begin dispensing the coloring foam into your hands. Then you just shampoo the foam into your hair until you've covered every strand. Leave for 30-40min, wash off afterwards, and voila!

**Product**: Baking Powder Pore Cleansing Foam

**Thoughts:** this is such a harsh cleanser. I got this in travel-size in a sample pack from Etude House when I signed up to be a member. Though I have not looked closely at the ingredient list, the thought of having baking powder in a cleanser suggests to me that it is pretty high-pH, which doesn't seem to be good for my skin at all. It is also really rough on the skin. Thankfully, I do not have sensitive skin. I am now trying to finish it up. I use it as my 2nd cleanser after using cleansing milk to remove my makeup.

I've seen some bloggers recommend their wipes from the same Baking Powder range and since I do use makeup wipes to remove my makeup once in a while, I may still give their Baking Powder cleansing wipes a shot.",skin type combination product baking powder pore cleansing foam thoughts harsh cleanser got travel size sample pack etude house signed member though looked closely ingredient list thought baking powder cleanser suggests pretty high ph seem good skin also really rough skin thankfully sensitive skin trying finish use nd cleanser using cleansing milk remove makeup seen bloggers recommend wipes baking powder range since use makeup wipes remove makeup may still give baking powder cleansing wipes shot

1fwyr5k,Looking for Dupe - Etude House Dear Darling Tint BK801,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"Nooo don't go down the rabbit hole searching for this tint! I've went through it. It leads to heartbreak and anger lmao. 

OK so... long rant but Etude House discontinued many shades from their dear darling tint line years back, including BK801 and one of my fave shades of lip tints ever (RD305). I searched EVERYWHERE for it when I found out... but alas, it was too late. üò© The formula of these tints just sadly went out of style I think. The reviews for BK801 in particular wasn't good though, (sticks to dry patches IIRC) so you're not missing out much lol.

Some similar-ish enough shades (none of em are exact tho) are Lilybyred Juicy Liar Water tint in Blackberry Tequila, Black rouge Mara Hot Water tint in LV05 (plumping) and Espoir Couture lip tint Shine in Vampy. Aaand if you want some unique lip tint shades check out Laka and Dinto!",nooo go rabbit hole searching tint went leads heartbreak anger lmao ok long rant etude house discontinued many shades dear darling tint line years back including bk one fave shades lip tints ever rd searched everywhere found alas late formula tints sadly went style think reviews bk particular good though sticks dry patches iirc missing much lol similar ish enough shades none em exact tho lilybyred juicy liar water tint blackberry tequila black rouge mara hot water tint lv plumping espoir couture lip tint shine vampy aaand want unique lip tint shades check laka dinto

803xkf,Trying every Etude House Air Therapy Mask!! [Review],Etude House,AsianBeauty,"Hey everyone! So I recently got back from Korea and decided to try every single edition of the Air Therapy masks from Etude house! These have been my favourite masks, and I‚Äôve already tried a few (those that aren‚Äôt in the picture) and will be updating through this post my thoughts on each Mask and whether or not I will repurchase.
My skin type is very dry/sensitive/minor natural wrinkles and so I‚Äôll be keeping this in mind when reviewing them! when im finished i'll be ranking them all, so keep this post saved! :) 
-
ps. I started off reviewing each of them in individual comments but I decided to keep them all in this master post for ease, so I deleted all the old reviews that didn't have comments on them!
-
**[OLIVE]** firming & moisturising This left my skin moisturised and plump. I found the texture of this essence (like a thicker emulsion) really pleasant and sunk in to my skin really well! The firming aspect of the Mask wasn‚Äôt as strong as the camellia or snail however, it feels mainly like a moisturising and slightly smoothing Mask. RECOMMENDATION - really liked this for my dry skin, however I feel like this is really similar to the snail Mask, but the snail is slightly better in my opinion. I would recommend this, however I feel like I‚Äôd rather just use the snail Mask instead.
-
**[SNAIL]** - smoothening and Firming This Mask is my favourite out of the lot! Very effective for my dry skin, and it also made my skin feel a lot smoother. The natural wrinkles/fine lines under my eyes were minimised, and overall my skin looked smoother and more plump. RECOMMENDATION - Loved this! I 100% would repurchase and recommend to all skin types, especially textured and damaged skin. Great all around Mask.
-
**[ARGAN]** Nourishing & moisturising So this Mask kinda disappointed me. While it was very nourishing and great for my dry skin, it didn‚Äôt sink in all the way in to my skin. It took a lot longer to massage it in to my skin, so it wasn‚Äôt the best for me. RECOMMENDATION - I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll repurchase this again. Also, I feel like oily and normal skin types would struggle with the essence as it doesn‚Äôt skin in nicely and can leave the skin with a film on top. Overall not recommended.
-
**[MANUKA HONEY]** - rich moisturisation Very moisturising Mask, quenched my extremely dry skin and my skin felt that way for a good few hours after! Overall really loved this one, however it lacks other obvious skincare benefits other than hydration so I tend to use this when my skin is going through a really dry patch. RECOMMENDATION - would repurchase this! Perfect for normal to very dry skin and not irritating on sensitive skin.
-
**[DAMASK ROSE]** - fresh moisture
Very light moisturising Mask. Watery essence, however caused some irritation on the thinner skin under my eyes. Overall the moisture was extremely lightweight and was refreshing, but not enough for my dry skin. RECOMMENDATION - I didn‚Äôt like this for my skin. However, I can see someone with oily- normal skin really enjoying this for a slight pick me up Mask. Do not recommend for sensitive skin, will not be repurchasing.
-
**[CAMELIA]** lifting and skin radiance
This Mask had a slight yellow tinge to it, a trait that the newer masks all share to some extent. However, I found that I really liked this Mask and that my fine lines were definitely reduced with this! The only thing is that it did irritate my under eyes a little bit, nothing too bad but it‚Äôs something that id only use at night so my skin can heal a little without makeup. RECOMMENDATION - all skin types except sensitive will love this Mask. I did repurchase this as I found the radiance and lifting aspect outweighed the slight irritation it gave me, so overall a good Mask. Eye holes are a little smaller IMO (I personally like that because I get more product on my under eye wrinkles) so keep that in mind if that‚Äôs not for you!
-
**[GREEN TEA]** Moisturising and soothing 
So i was kinda skeptical of this mask and decided to try it first thing in the morning when the skin under my eyes can be a little irritated. HOWEVER I REALLY LIKED THIS MASK!! the irritation under my eyes was calmed considerably, and this mask left my skin looking really hydrated and with a slight glow - not unlike the hyaluronic acid mask. RECOMMENDATION - i would repurchase this mask! i really like it for the mornings when my skin is more sensitive, and just needs a slight pick me up! great for all skin types and sensitive skin. 
-
**[HYALURONIC ACID]** - Skin Moisturising 
this was the very first AB product I ever tried so this is quite sentimental to me haha. I really liked how this left my skin looking really glowy and hydrated, however this mask did cause some very slight irritation around my eyes. I gave some of this mask to my friend who has normal/not sensitive skin and she adored it! RECOMMENDATION - would recommend for those with normal/dry skin as long as it's not sensitive, and i wont personally be repurchasing, but my friend bought SEVERAL dozens while in korea! 
-
**[COLLAGEN]** Skin Firming
this mask is a emulsion type that aims to firm your skin as the name suggests. I really liked this mask and I found that my skin did feel firmer and the wrinkles under my eyes had been reduced, especially once I rubbed all the essence in to my skin. RECOMMENDATION - I really liked this mask and feel like it would work well for sensitive skin, as well as all skin types. However, I have to say that it's very similar to the snail mask, but I think I would buy the snail over collagen as I feel like the snail does the same thing and more. 
-
**[TEA TREE]** Refreshing & Soothing 
So I had low expectations for this mask as I don't have really problematic skin and tend to use tea tree spot treatments to treat the few acne I do have. HOWEVER I WAS WONDERFULLY IMPRESSED! I noticed an obvious de-puffing effect, and the texture of my skin became ever so slightly smoothed. My skin felt really nice and looked very radiant - definitely underestimated the power of tea tree! RECOMMENDATION - I would buy this again! really perfect for a morning routine as the de puffing and soothing quality is definitely there. I think this is definitely something problematic/normal/oily skin would love, but sensitive skin is also welcome! Dry skin would need a bit more in the hydration department, however as this mask wasn't geared towards that I don't think it's a con. 
-
**[CERAMIDE]** - Deep Moisturising 
This is definitely one of my favourite masks for my dry skin days. The emulsion type essence is quite thick and takes longer to absorb in to the skin than other masks, so that‚Äôs something to be aware of even though I personally don‚Äôt mind it because the moisture lasts a while. RECOMMENDATION - I actually stocked up on this Mask when I was in Korea, and always reach for it first when my skin feels drier than usual. I would recommend this for dry skin types as oily to normal skin might find it harder to absorb and too much hydration.

10oaru1,Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 Foam Cleanser reformulation‚Ä¶ And now it sucks,Etude House,AsianBeauty,"So yup, the **Etude House Soon Jung 5.5 Foam Cleanser** has been reformulated.

I'm not sure how long ago since I first bought the original version when it first launched sometime in 2018 or 2019 and it had a very basic ingredients list, as seen in Pic 2. The bottle I've received now I bought at the end of the year and received it in December 22, and as you can see the ingredients have changed almost completely. Not sure why the websites haven't updated their lists yet as I had no idea this had changed and was quite miffed to see that now it has fatty alcohols and other esters.

Cleansing-wise it's a lot harsher, the foam isn't as nice and doesn't foam quite as well. It irritated my face pretty badly after three days and stung a lot, so it will be relegated to body wash duties since unfortunately I bought two, thinking it was the same as the cleanser I previously liked and used before. My skin is combo oily currently in winter climate and using a lot of actives, so I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin. I think it also contributed to some CCs and pimples on my chin. :(

1i4gkya,Review Etude Double Lasting foundation,Etude,AsianBeauty,"I spent about 3 hours yesterday deciding between ordering which shade of the Unleashia Healthy Green cushion.

The only foundation I've tried is the Romand Bare Water cushion in #1, it's noted to be 17. My mum hates it because it adds no colour to my face. I'm white, fairly pale and cool toned. I like the mesh cushion and formula, and I was going to buy the next shade up (pink undertone, 21)

However I became interested in the Unleashia one. I  figured I should move up from 18C because it would be close to 17. Then I was choosing between 21C or 21N. Ordered the latter in the end, I'm thinking I could be slightly neutral.

Location: west coast, US

I just got the Etude soon jung x director‚Äôs sunscreen and finally tried it today! 

TLDR: on par with the round lab birch juice sunscreen. A bit less moisturizing but more lightweight. I‚Äôd recommend it.

Overall, this is an essence/cream type sunscreen. The texture is thicker than gel, but not as thick as cream. When applied on face, I could feel the moisture burst on my skin. It glides very well and doesn‚Äôt not feel sticky at all. 

I can‚Äôt choose a clear winner when comparing this to my current favorite, Round lab birch juice moisturizing sunscreen. The Etude one is less moisturizing but more lightweight and less sticky, so I find it works better with makeup.

kwytrz,Best & Worst of Etude House,Etude,AsianBeauty,"**Skin Type:** Combination 

*Best:*

**Product:** the entire Moistfull Collagen line

**Thoughts:** Holy moly, is this line just amazing! The texture is creamy and leaves my skin so soft. The scent is light and pleasant. My only criticism is that they repackaged it, and it looks a little cheap now. But don't be fooled - what's inside feels luxurious. One of the best lines of skincare I've ever tried, hands down. I'd call it an HG, but tbh, I find myself ""saving"" it for nights when I want to feel a bit more pampered.

**Product:** Soonjung Hydro Barrier Cream 

**Thoughts:** A lovely, light water cream that absorbs well and hydrates nicely. Like the rest of the Soonjung line, it has no scent and is relatively minimalistic. Just bought a backup!

*Meh:*

**Product:** Soonjung ph 5.5 Relief Toner 

**Thoughts:** I use this twice a day immediately after cleansing and let it stay wet when I apply my HA serum. It does the job, but I can't see any unique benefit to it.

kwytrz,Best & Worst of Etude House,Etude,AsianBeauty,"**Skin Type/Concerns:** Combo acne/dehydration-prone skin that swings drier in winter and oily in summer

**Product Name:** Soonjung 2x Barrier Relief Cream

**Thoughts:** HATED this. I know it's HG for a lot of people but I just didn't like it. It felt nice on the skin at first but within 20-30min I would somehow look like a greaseball and simultaneously feel like I'd never applied moisturizer at all and desperately needed more. I'm also fairly sure it broke me out. It did not get along well with my skin at all.  


\~\~\~\~\~

**Product Name:** Soonjung 10-Free Moist Emulsion

**Thoughts:** This stuff is DELIGHTFUL. It's my new favourite summer moisturizer hands-down. VERY hydrating, doesn't break me out. Even in the summer when my skin is greasier I tend to find gels/gel creams too light, like there's too much water and not enough there to hold it in and my skin feels tight again fast. This gives me that hydration and a little bit of that oil to seal things in without going overboard and making me feel greasy. It's too light for me as a winter moisturizer though.  


\~\~\~\~\~\~  


**Product Name:** Soonjung Panthenoside 5 Sleeping Pack

**Thoughts:** I love this as well and think it's under-hyped. This is the thickest, most occlusive moisturizer I can use without breaking out. It has a very balm-like texture and I can FEEL it soothing my skin as it goes on. Definitely helps calm inflamed acne/healing areas. If you use it with a light hand it dries down pretty nicely and could work well as a regular moisturizer but I prefer to use it a bit more generously as an actual sleeping mask and I really love it. I do wish it was maybe a little more hydrating but overall, I can't gripe too much about it. It works really well on the lips, too - when you close the nozzle on the tube (if you haven't used one of these before, the tubes have like.... a really interesting dispenser that you can twist to lock shut so product won't accidentally squeeze out) it squirts a little extra product out automatically and I usually use that on my lips because it feels great, helps keep them soft, and doesn't taste terrible if you accidentally lick some of it off, it actually tastes slightly sweet (I mean, don't eat it, please don't deliberately eat moisturizer, but you get what I mean I hope).",skin type concerns combo acne dehydration prone skin swings drier winter oily summer product name soonjung x barrier relief cream thoughts hated know hg lot people like felt nice skin first within min would somehow look like greaseball simultaneously feel like never applied moisturizer desperately needed also fairly sure broke get along well skin product name soonjung free moist emulsion thoughts stuff delightful new favourite summer moisturizer hands hydrating break even summer skin greasier tend find gels gel creams light like much water enough hold skin feels tight fast gives hydration little bit oil seal things without going overboard making feel greasy light winter moisturizer though product name soonjung panthenoside sleeping pack thoughts love well think hyped thickest occlusive moisturizer use without breaking balm like texture feel soothing skin goes definitely helps calm inflamed acne healing areas use light hand dries pretty nicely could work well regular moisturizer prefer use bit generously actual sleeping mask really love wish maybe little hydrating overall gripe much works really well lips close nozzle tube used one tubes like really interesting dispenser twist lock shut product accidentally squeeze squirts little extra product automatically usually use lips feels great helps keep soft taste terrible accidentally lick actually tastes slightly sweet mean eat please deliberately eat moisturizer get mean hope

But the powder sometimes made my skin feel tight and shiny so when innisfree released the moisture powder(purple) I was so excited to try it out. Turns out, it had a few critical flaws.

**1. The powder bunches up.**

Whenever I try to get the powder out it always takes a few shakes and even then it refuses to come out more than is satisfactory. Every. single. time. the powder clogges the teeny-tiny squares. If you look at the photo, you can see that the powder sticks together unlike the original fromula (green).

**2. It's not very effective.**

The Mineral powder(green) could make even the greasiest of sunscreen more or less good on my skin, whereas the Moisture powser(purple).. just makes me sweat more from trying to get it out of

I came across this when I needed a new toner, and it has done my skin WONDERS. It refreshes and hydrates my skin every morning, starting off the day fresh. 

Green tea:

* Rich in antioxidants that battle against sun exposure and slows down aging (causing wrinkles and age spots)
* Has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory benefits that help reduce inflammation and acne
* Contains polyphenols that provide skin-soothing benefits and improve the appearance of sun-damaged skin

Review:

I use this toner only in my morning skincare routine. This toner is a little different where it is a little thicker, like an essence, compared to most toners. It‚Äôs very hydrating to my skin, making it look supple and fresh with moisture. The scent is very light and smells like green tea itself. After application, my skin doesn‚Äôt feel super sticky, but refreshed and cool. 

How to use: After washing your face with a cleanser, pat dry your skin. Apply a small amount of toner into the palms of your hand, and massage it all over your face. Let your skin absorb the product (until your face feels a little sticky or dry) before applying other products.

Recently, I‚Äôve been trying new skincare products from my recent haul from Dodoskin ([dodoskin.com](http://dodoskin.com/)). I love being able to find my fave Korean brands, so there‚Äôs definitely going to be more hauls üí∏.

About this product:

* consists of green tea extract and seed oil that are full of antioxidants and have antibacterial properties that can help clear your skin
* there is fragrance + limonene + linalool - ingredients that can be sensitizing and irritating :(
* includes glycerin that replenishes moisture to your skin
* has citric acid for chemical exfoliation

Review: 

Innisfree‚Äôs Green Tea Seed Serum was my very first skincare product that I tried and loved, so I decided to try another product from the line: the toner. This toner is very watery and includes green tea leaf extract and seed oil that provide antioxidants and hydration to your skin. There‚Äôs also citric acid which is an AHA (good for chemical exfoliating) and glycerin that provides more hydration to your skin. This is super cooling and refreshing on my skin, so it definitely wakes me up in the morning. My biggest issue with this is: fragrance. Sadly, there‚Äôs not only fragrance, but also limonene & linalool. These two ingredients (plus fragrance) can be quite sensitizing, so it definitely can cause issues for those with sensitive skin. Personally, this wasn‚Äôt my favorite toner based on the ingredients. I‚Äôve used ones with better formulas, so I won‚Äôt be going back to this toner. 

How to use: 

After cleansing your skin, use a cotton pad and pour some toner onto it. Gently swipe it across your face, prepping your skin for absorbing other skincare products. Then, follow up with your normal skincare routine.

#rice

While I‚Äôm usually not a fan of cream-type masks, this one was pretty likeable. First of all, the fit of the sheet was much better than the others in the range that I‚Äôve tried so far and pretty close to the old It‚Äôs Real Squeeze masks (the material, of course, is different). There was no strong fragrance and the cream, white and drippy, was not overly sticky.

I decided to follow the instructions on the packet this time and leave it on for only 20 minutes, and I could pretty much still see a layer of the cream on the mask when the time was up. 

It did brighten up my complexion a little immediately after as well as the next morning. It also moisturised heavily ‚Äì I skipped my Hada Labo water gel that night ‚Äì and my pores didn‚Äôt feel clogged at all. There was A LOT of essence left on the mask as well as in the packet, and when I used the leftovers for the next few days it could pretty much replace my Hada Labo water gel.

8upq33,[Review] Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask Pt.1 - Cream Texture Series,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I previously reviewed Innisfree's Skin Clinic line [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8rkyx4/review_entire_range_of_innisfree_skin_clinic_masks/). This time, I will be reviewing all the masks in this My Real Squeeze line, but splitting the reviews into the 3 main mask categories, each comprising of 6 masks:

* Cream¬†
* [Essence](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8vtrbl/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt2/)
* [Water](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8wuhze/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt3/)

(To prevent confusion, here's a clarification that I will be referring to all the mask¬†*juices* as 'essence' regardless of their types) In general, the¬†essences in this series aren't as generous as the water or essence-type masks. All the masks are very well-coated with cream but there's barely any left in the packaging, as compared to the other water and essence-type masks which usually leave sufficient¬†essence to cover my arms and legs as well.¬†

All the masks in the My Real Squeeze series are made of a thin cellulose(?) material that holds on to the mask essences really well. In comparison to the Innisfree's Skin Clinic series, these are slightly thicker/coarser and don't dry out as quick as those. It differs from mask to mask but I'd say drying time ranges from 20-40min.

I have dry, sensitive skin, but I usually avoid masks with thicker consistencies as I really dislike having any sort of tacky finish on my face. For the sake of trying the cream masks in this line, I tried¬†to review them as objectively as possible and yes, all of them left sticky residues on my face though some more than others. I used these in my PM routine after my serums and skipped the cream step. The sequence of my reviews below are in order of their heaviness,¬†thickest being Shea Butter and lightest being Ginseng/Oatmeal.¬†

**Shea Butter (moisturising) - 2/5**

I'm not a fan of the sweet powdery scent characteristic of shea in the first place, so the fragrance of this mask was already slightly off-putting for me. This left an oily layer that just sat on top of my skin after 20min of application, and was never fully absorbed as I woke up still shiny even till the next morning. I found this mask really heavy and occlusive, and seemed more suitable for folks with really dry skin and in severe need of moisture. Oily faces; steer clear! For a similar viscosity, I'd much¬†rather prefer the rice or coconut one below as they seem to do much more.¬†

**Coconut (soothing) - 4/5**

This mask has a smooth, creamy texture that felt particularly comfortable and cushiony on my face. It has a subtle but distinct coconutty scent that I quite rather enjoyed, but I guess it depends on individual preference. My skin did indeed look calmer after use, but it left a discernible, sticky layer on my skin which didn't sink in fully. Most of it was gone by the next morning¬†(not on my pillow¬†i¬†hope!), but my face looked really smooth and well-moisturised. I'd give this a¬†5/5 if not for its¬†tackiness and long absorption time, and may RP if I haven't found another lighter alternative that both soothes and moisturises.¬†

**Acai Berry (nourishing) - 2/5**

This has a slight, pleasant fruity scent, and a heavy cream texture. Most of the essence on the mask was transferred to my face at the end of 20min, but left my face looking like it was drenched in the cream and didn't really absorb even after gently rubbing and patting it in. That said, it was mostly gone by the next morning, and my skin looked a tad brighter after washing it off. Unfortunately, I had a¬†sensitive patch on my cheek from an earlier reaction a day before, and¬†despite being mostly subsided at the time of application, it was raised and itchy again after removing this mask. I'm not entirely sure if that was brought on by this mask, but to be on the safe side, I WNRP this in spite of its merits.¬†

**Rice (clarifying) - 3/5**

This mask gave a slight brightening effect after use, but left a really tacky and occlusive finish on my skin. I suppose this might be more suitable for really dry skin. I noticed that my skin tone looked slightly more even the next day, but besides that there wasn't anything much about this mask that¬†impressed me.

**Oatmeal (moisturising) - 5/5**

Wow. Okay given my bias against¬†masks/any facial products with a heavy, tacky finish, I was not expecting any masks in this series to score anything beyond 4/5 but I'm willing to tolerate the stickiness for this mask. This was still¬†creamy but less viscous than the first¬†4 masks above, with a texture more like an emulsion or lotion than a cream. There was almost no distinguishable scent to this, and the mask was almost dry at the end of 20min, with most of the essence transferred to my face. The redness on my face had visibly subsided and my skintone looked pretty evened out. Despite leaving a sticky residue, it was mostly absorbed overnight and left my face looking pretty well-moisturised the next morning. I wouldn't say this is HG status as of yet, but will def RP anytime I'm in need of a moisturising+soothing treat.¬†

**Ginseng (nourishing) - 3/5**

This mask had a faint but distinctly bitter scent of ginseng, which was slightly confusing¬†for me as I've associated that scent with the herbal soups my grandma makes ~~LOL asian family ftw~~. This had a similar, lightweight texture with the oatmeal one. My skin did look slightly more moisturised and plumper after use, but I didn't notice anything else impressive beyond that and its effects didn't really last through the night till the next day, so it was pretty \~meh.¬†

aig84b,[Review] Innisfree Derma Formula Skin Barrier Cream - great for dehydrated skin,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I wanted to finally post a review of the Innisfree Derma Formula Skin Barrier Cream since I had a chance to really test it and I never really see it mentioned here. 

This cream is light but enough to be an occlusive in the summer and day time winter moisturizer. It is oil-free and the main reason why I chose this cream is because it has the holy trinity for a damaged moisture barrier: **ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids**. Other products that are HG for some and include these important barrier ingredients are Stratia Liquid Gold, Epiceram (prescription) and I think Cerave in the tub... but all these broke me out due to petrolatum or oils. 

Ingredients: *Water, Butylene Glycol, Squalane, Glycerine, Butylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, Behenyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Bispalmitamide MEA, C14-22 alcohols, Hydroxypropyl Bislauramide MEA, Stearic Acid, Ceramide NP, Camellia Sinensis Seed Extract, Phytosphingosine, Orchid, Camellia Japonica Leaf Extract, Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Opuntia Coccinellifera Fruit Extract, Hydrogenated lecithin, Cholesterol, Glucose, Palmitic Acid, C12-20 Alkyl Glucoside, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexanediol, Sorbitan isostearate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Tromethamine, Disodium EDTA*

&#x200B;

If you're looking everywhere for a heavier moisturizer to repair your moisture barrier with actual good barrier ingredients that is acne-safe, -fragrance free- and kbeauty, try it out. I've been using it for 2 weeks so far and definitely feel my skin being thicker and stronger instead of paper thin. Also, it seems like this moisturizer smoothes my skin too so it feels less sand papery. I'm a guy with a damaged moisture barrier, so trying to take baby steps in editing my routine and looking to only include products with good ingredients. 

I bought mine from Beautytap but I've seen it on yesstyle too. 

Edit: Not fragrance free apparently. missed the fruit extracts in the ingredients. Plant extracts, although lighter and less concentrated that plant oils, are still included in for fragrance. Do note that I did not smell anything when using the cream though.",wanted finally post review innisfree derma formula skin barrier cream since chance really test never really see mentioned cream light enough occlusive summer day time winter moisturizer oil free main reason chose cream holy trinity damaged moisture barrier ceramides cholesterol fatty acids products hg include important barrier ingredients stratia liquid gold epiceram prescription think cerave tub broke due petrolatum oils ingredients water butylene glycol squalane glycerine butylene glycol dicaprylate dicaprate behenyl alcohol hydroxypropyl bispalmitamide mea c alcohols hydroxypropyl bislauramide mea stearic acid ceramide np camellia sinensis seed extract phytosphingosine orchid camellia japonica leaf extract citrus unshiu peel extract camellia sinensis leaf extract opuntia coccinellifera fruit extract hydrogenated lecithin cholesterol glucose palmitic acid c alkyl glucoside ethylhexylglycerin hexanediol sorbitan isostearate hydroxyethyl acrylate sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer tromethamine disodium edta looking everywhere heavier moisturizer repair moisture barrier actual good barrier ingredients acne safe fragrance free kbeauty try using weeks far definitely feel skin thicker stronger instead paper thin also seems like moisturizer smoothes skin feels less sand papery guy damaged moisture barrier trying take baby steps editing routine looking include products good ingredients bought mine beautytap seen yesstyle edit fragrance free apparently missed fruit extracts ingredients plant extracts although lighter less concentrated plant oils still included fragrance note smell anything using cream though

821c3u,[Review] Innisfree Aqua UV Protection Cream Water Drop SPF 50+ PA++++,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I recently bought this off after seeing it on Jolse and noticed there weren't really any reviews of it here or on other blogs. This is a chemical-only/organic sunscreen with the following filters: **homosalate, ethylhexyl salicylate, ethylhexyl triazone, avobenzene, and bis-ethyolhexyloxypheno methoxyphenyl triazine \(Tinsorb S\)**. Innisfree describes it as ""*A powerful sun protection cream with an ultra-light, moisture-splashing texture. Glides on easily and absorbed quickly. Non-greasy and non-sticky. Protects skin against long - wave UVA and UVB as well as harmful pollution.*"" 

This sunscreen also supposedly contains centella asiatica extract, tumeric root extract, green tea extract, among some other skin-nurturing ingredients, but there's no information on percentages and I wouldn't rely on my sunscreen to have ingredients that make my mug look better (other than the UV protection).

That being said, I mostly bought this on impulse because I realized it didn't have ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate and it looked like it might be similar to Biore's UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence (my old HG, before they revamped it and I realized EM was the source of my breakouts). I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed!

It has an essence texture really similar to the Watery Essence and upon application, feels incredibly similar but dries down a bit slower and doesn't have that make-up primer finish, likely because it also doesn't contain any alcohol or dimethicone. I did need to powder my face a little bit to get a more natural skinfinish but this definitely doesn't feel heavy or greasy while applying or on the skin. My skin neither felt dried out nor oily or congested after a few hours of wearing it (full disclosure: I have extremely dehydrated skin that produces a pretty significant amount of grease, but also have eczema which leads to lots of flaky dry skin). Overall, I'm happy to add this to my sunscreen wardrobe and will likely repurchase another tube.",recently bought seeing jolse noticed really reviews blogs chemical organic sunscreen following filters homosalate ethylhexyl salicylate ethylhexyl triazone avobenzene bis ethyolhexyloxypheno methoxyphenyl triazine tinsorb innisfree describes powerful sun protection cream ultra light moisture splashing texture glides easily absorbed quickly non greasy non sticky protects skin long wave uva uvb well harmful pollution sunscreen also supposedly contains centella asiatica extract tumeric root extract green tea extract among skin nurturing ingredients information percentages rely sunscreen ingredients make mug look better uv protection said mostly bought impulse realized ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate looked like might similar biore uv aqua rich watery essence old hg revamped realized em source breakouts happy say disappointed essence texture really similar watery essence upon application feels incredibly similar dries bit slower make primer finish likely also contain alcohol dimethicone need powder face little bit get natural skinfinish definitely feel heavy greasy applying skin skin neither felt dried oily congested hours wearing full disclosure extremely dehydrated skin produces pretty significant amount grease also eczema leads lots flaky dry skin overall happy add sunscreen wardrobe likely repurchase another tube

88rkrb,[Review] Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask #cucumber (<3),Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I'm back with my second review of the new Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask range!

My skin: Early 20s combination, dehydrated skin (oily T-panel and large pores on cheeks). I had really good complexion in my teens, but I‚Äôve been breaking out a lot recently and the condition of my skin has deteriorated loads. Grew up in a tropical country, currently surviving the harsh dry air of Melbourne.

#cucumber

This is an essence-type mask; it‚Äôs light on the skin yet hydrating, and has little to no fragrance as far as I can tell. As I previously mentioned, I‚Äôm not a fan of the new sheets because of the cut and texture.

I left it on for an hour or more until the mask dried out partially. INSTANT EFFECTS. I had a few reddish bumps on my face prior to this and my skin wasn‚Äôt looking great, but this mask gave me the glow-up + refresh I needed. The bumps seemed to have disappeared immediately after, but returned the next morning although they looked much less obvious (they went away a few days later). There was a lot of essence left over in the packet, so I kept that and used it as an extra hydration step over the next couple of days.

Repurchase? YES.

8wuhze,[Review] Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask Pt.3 - Refreshing Water Series,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I will be reviewing all the masks in this My Real Squeeze line, but splitting the reviews into the 3 main mask types:

* [Cream¬†](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8upq33/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt1_cream/)
* [Essence](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8vtrbl/review_innisfree_my_real_squeeze_mask_pt2/)
* Water

The essences in this series, as its name suggests, has a thin, watery consistency. The essences are quite generous in volume, with the masks well-coated in them and usually with sufficient remainder to spread on my neck, arms and legs or to re-use as a DIY mask with cotton pads/sheet masks.¬†I have dry, sensitive skin, and I usually avoid masks with thicker consistencies as I really dislike having any sort of tacky finish on my face. These are definitely a lot more bearable than the texture of the cream-type series I reviewed earlier. I use these at the serum step of my routine, after toner and before moisturiser. However, for its thin consistency, most of the masks in this series strangely do leave sticky residues that don't fully absorb after application, but it bothers me minimally as I pat them in when I apply the rest of my routine.¬†

All the masks in the My Real Squeeze series are made of a thin cellulose(?) material that holds on to the mask essences really well. In comparison to the Innisfree's Skin Clinic series, these are slightly thicker/coarser and don't dry out as quick as those. It differs from mask to mask but I'd say drying time ranges from 20-40min. Unfortunately I felt quite underwhelmed by the masks in this range(hence the shorter reviews) and there weren't any that particularly stood out to me, except perhaps bamboo and broccoli.¬†

**Rose (revitalising)¬†- 3/5**

This carries a subtle, pleasant rose scent. However, it¬† did nothing much in terms of subsiding redness or brightening, and while it was slightly hydrating, there was nothing much else impressive about this mask.¬†

**Bamboo (soothing)¬†- 4/5**

This one has a gentle, refreshing scent, and I enjoy how soothing this is. The redness on my face was definitely subsided after application, and my skin looked well-hydrated the next¬†morning. However, for its soothing properties, it still can't match up to the Innisfree's Skin Clinic Madecassoside Mask (My HG! [Review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/8rkyx4/review_entire_range_of_innisfree_skin_clinic_masks/) ) so I don't think I'll go back to this unless the madecassoside one gets discontinued for some reason one day.

**Green Tea (soothing)¬†- 3/5**

I know this is a popular one amongst many ABers but it just didn't do it for me. For one, I thought there was a weird stale smell to this (no, it wasn't a bad one since I've tried this multiple times and they all smell the same). Scent aside, this mask was slightly hydrating but apart from that, it didn't¬†do much else.¬†¬†

**Broccoli¬†(clarifying)¬†- 4/5**

This was one of those masks with dubious ingredients (broccoli?? skincare??) and I was definitely skeptical, but ended up liking this more than I intended to. It has a faint, refreshing scent with no trace of broccoli, in case anyone's wondering. I find that this evens out my skintone on days where I look dull and blotchy, and the best part is that the effects noticeably last till the next day. This is missing the 5/5 spot only because I wish it did a little more than just evening out my skintone, plus the effects are quite subtle especially if your skin isn't red/splotchy to begin with.¬†

**Lime (revitalising)¬†- 3/5**

Similar to the cucumber mask I reviewed previously in the essence series, I found this to have a citrusy, soapy scent LOL. This did brighten my skin immediately after application, but returned to its usual dull state the next day. For brightening properties, I'd much rather purchase the pomegranate mask in the essence series.¬†

**Tea Tree(clarifying)** **- 2/5**

I used this when I was having one of my hormonal breakouts, and I had high hopes after hearing how well this worked at flattening and soothing acne for other users. Unfortunately, this did little for my spots. I managed to snap a before/after photo of one of my acne spots [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/LzdrqOM) \- the first was when it was still angry and swollen from my attempt at squeezing it, the second was after 20min of masking, and the third was merely 5min after applying my Benton Snail Bee Essence(my HG for soothing!). Clearly the Benton did a lot more at bringing down the surrounding redness and swelling than the mask did, and the spot remained on my face for the next few days. Also, giving this a 2 because I'm personally biased against the scent of tea tree, though I must say the tea tree scent here is rather bearable.

8g7pm3,[Review] Innisfree My Real Squeeze Mask #teatree,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"My skin: Early 20s combination, dehydrated skin \(oily T\-panel and large pores on cheeks\). I had really good complexion in my teens, but I‚Äôve been breaking out a lot recently and the condition of my skin has deteriorated loads. Grew up in a tropical country, currently surviving the harsh dry air of Melbourne.

#teatree

Another water\-type mask from the Innisfree My Real Squeeze line! I decided to go with this one instead of my usual cream\-essence\-water sequence because I was having a few angry pimples on my temple. Their old bija was one of my favourites so I was really excited to see if this could replace it... and MIRACLES WERE PERFORMED.

The fit of the mask, as usual, wasn‚Äôt as good as the old ones, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as some of the others I tried \(looking at you, broccoli\). There was little to no scent. I left it on for about an hour and removed it when I felt the mask getting dry \(but it was still damp, so relax friends ‚Äì I don‚Äôt leave it overnight\).

Have I said that MIRACLES WERE PERFORMED?

My skin instantly felt pampered, calmer and hydrated. By the next morning, my pimples were flattened and fading. That‚Äôs a HG, right there.

I applied the leftover essence with my hands over the next few days, but somehow I didn‚Äôt feel it to be as effective as when I did the mask. My forehead started to breakout after that \(the type when my face gets a bit oily\), but I‚Äôm attributing this to 4 extremely late nights in a row and lack of water.",skin early combination dehydrated skin oily panel large pores cheeks really good complexion teens breaking lot recently condition skin deteriorated loads grew tropical country currently surviving harsh dry air melbourne another water type mask innisfree real squeeze line decided go one instead usual cream essence water sequence angry pimples temple old bija one favourites really excited see could replace miracles performed fit mask usual good old ones bad others tried looking broccoli little scent left hour removed felt mask getting dry still damp relax friends leave overnight said miracles performed skin instantly felt pampered calmer hydrated next morning pimples flattened fading hg right applied leftover essence hands next days somehow feel effective mask forehead started breakout type face gets bit oily attributing extremely late nights row lack water

The good:

Love the smell and it absorbs quickly and feels like it sucks all the previous layers in with it, making my Mr Honey & Miss Flower Essence Oil Stickness disappear. It leaves a nice cooling sensation for a couple of minutes which I enjoy.

The bad:

I think the emollients were making my rough patches temporarily feel smoother but now that I have products that are actually dealing with the roughness, it's kind of meh. I agree that it's not particularly occlusive and it's too light for me. I put Nivea in the tub over the top for a few nights as a trial and my skin was much softer and plumper the next morning. So clearly I can tolerate and benefit from something a bit more heavy duty and am looking forward to trying the TCFS Pumpkin pack when it runs out (If my COSRX rice mask sample doesn't arrive first). I also find I miss the beads occasionally when I'm applying and then have to scratch them off my face in the morning. 

3/5 for me: not great, not awful, would not repurchase.

**product: super volcanic pore clay mask 2x**

**thoughts**: my favourite clay mask. light, creamy texture that feels really nice and cooling on the skin. gentle enough that it doesn't dry out or hurt my skin, but also strong enough that with consistent use my face is noticeably smoother, clearer, and brighter. my skin feels fresh, calm, and even immediately after use as well. i repurchase every time i run out.

**product: green tea seed serum**

**thoughts**: is it the most phenomenal hydrating serum in the world? no, but it works and i still like it. feels extremely cooling and refreshing. it is fragranced, but i actually like the fragrance, or maybe i just associate it now with that feeling of an instant burst of hydration lol. i feel like it helped to decrease the appearance of sebaceous filaments on my nose as well.

**product: my real squeeze masks**

**thoughts**: a $2 mask that smacks. mostly they're all hydrating but i love the variety anyway, i think the cream varieties tend to work the best (though if you have oily skin you'd probably prefer the watery essence varieties instead).

**product: microcara**

**thoughts**: i use the skinny longlongcara but i think they all work similarly. this is the one mascara i always hoard the little spoolie from and will immediately repurchase if i lose it. it is AMAZING. so tiny yet still ridged, it works fantastically for giving gentle and natural separated definition to the upper lashes, and is easy to use on the lower lashes and even brows as well. it's literally the definition of my lashes but better - you don't look like you're wearing makeup at all (unless you're blond and wearing black mascara, obviously), you just look like you have naturally more defined eyes and naturally slightly fluffier lashes. the actual formula of the mascara is quite dry, but you can use the wand with a wetter formula if you prefer something less natural.

**product: eyeshadow singles**

**thoughts**: the glitters are my favourites, they differ in opacity depending on the shade but they are stunning, blend well, zero fall-out, can be sheered or built up. some shades are actual true fine shimmers and not the typical matte-loaded-with-sparkle korean shimmers like most etude house shimmers, for example. the mattes are also pretty nice, a bit on the dry side imo, but that makes them easy to build seamlessly and softly. you can make custom palettes.

**product: vivid cotton ink**

**thoughts**: not my all time favourite formula, they are very heavily pigmented, transfer if too thick, and don't really stain. BUT, the darker shades are super beautiful blotted thinly onto the lips; the lighter shades, i find, emphasise lip lines, but actually make for the most amazing liquid blushes that blend seamlessly on the skin, last extremely well, and give a radiant demi-matte natural finish. the formula of this is also super creamy, making them perfect for mixing shades ;) also, the **vivid creamy tints** used to be one of my favourite glossy stains, but unfortunately they have been discontinued, damn you innisfree-

&#x200B;

WORST

**product**: always new auto liner

**thoughts**: i'm not difficult to please, but this one was just... *too* difficult. dried out fast, which made it skip and unpigmented and brittle, and the sharpening mechanism wasn't that great either. i prefer their gel pencil eyeliners a lot more, if you don't mind a slightly blunt tip/aren't aiming for super sharp wings - pigmented, smooth, can be smudged out, but set decently.

&#x200B;

everything else i've tried by them is just good or meh, including: the orchid line (sample size), the pomegranate line (sample size), capsule recipe mask (rice, bija&aloe, bija& teatree), apple seed cleansing oil (sample size), camellia hair serum, no sebum powder, no sebum primer, mineral makeup base (purple), cherry blossom tone-up cream, cherry blossom mist, twinkle glitter liner, powder blush, cream blush, green tea lip balm. i'd advise those with sensitive skin to be wary though, many of my friends have had innisfree break them out; one had a cleanser wreck their moisture barrier.

ks64ia,Best & Worst Of Innisfree,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"**Skin Type/Concerns** : acne prone oily skin 

**BEST** 

- My lipbalm : very smooth and spreadable, sinks instantly into the lips and keeps moisturizing my dehydrated lips throughout the day. (Not sure if it could withstand winter / windy climate though, currently live in a hot & humid area, but then we're all wearing masks when going out so I think they won't disappear from the harsh wind) 

- Bija cica gel : not moisturizing or hydrating (not their focus anyway), but it does work at calming an irritated / sensitized skin. Instantly calmed down my itchiness. Doesn't give me acne too unlike other cica/centella balms I've tried. Though I don't think it did anything to my acne. 

- Super volcanic mousse : very easy to spread because it doesn't dry up like the jar version. Doesn't suck all the moisture out of your skin while still being effective enough to maintain the oil production. There's a slight, fresh cooling feel.

- Water glow jelly essence mask : not sure if I should include this since it's only sold in China but this is the only sheet mask that doesn't irritate my skin (but then I haven't tried sheet masks from more than 10 different brands since I'm scared of them lol) I love the thick gel essence so much. 

- Green tea mint fresh shampoo : works for my oily scalp, my go to shampoo when my scalp feels so gross and itchy from other shampoo's buildups. There's a nice cooling feels on my scalp too that actually calms down my scalp, nothing too extreme unlike those cheap minty shampoo for men lol. 

- Auto eyebrow pencil : I mean it's cheap and good, not much to say. I got very oily at the end of the day but it stays right there on my hairless eyebrows, would only disappear if I scratch my eyebrows when my own oils are irritating my skin lmao 

- Nail polish : also cheap and good, wide arrays of colors and beautiful glitters for the price. 

**WORST** 

- My real squeeze mask : proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin. Loaded with fragrance and alcohol, instantly irritated my skin the moment I put them on. Face felt itchy and hot. Really wanted them to work but I rarely have any good experience with sheet masks anyway so probably not entirely their fault idk 

- Green tea seed serum : obviously not sensitive skin friendly. Irritated from the fragrance and maybe the high alcohol content. Agree with the other redditor that they always give out this sample. I've collected so much of them, maybe I should just sell them in bulks lmao

- Daily UV protection cream no sebum : hard to apply evenly because it's like spreading chalky white paint on your skin. Would cling onto dry flaky patches if you have any, just not cosmetically elegant. The most white cast-y sunscreen in my drawer, I meant it when I said chalky white paint.

ajaucf,"[Review] Muji, Cosrx, Heimish, Soonjung, Hada Labo, and Innisfree cleansing foams",Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"To date, I've tried SIX different AB cleansers! I guess you can call me a cleanser guinea pig LOL.

For background purposes, I live in Canada, and have normal to dry skin.

Shown:

1. Muji Face Soap Scrub
2. Cosrx Good Morning Gel Cleanser
3. Heimish All Clean Green Foam
4. Etude House Soonjung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser
5. Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam

Not shown:

1. Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm going to be **evaluating** each cleanser on the following **criteria**:

* Is it pH balanced? (slightly acidic, range from 5 to 7?)
* Is it non-drying? (Avec the non-scientific method of not moisturizing afterwards and seeing if my skin is crying)
* Is it affordable, and easy to find?
* Is it made of safe ingredients? (Avec EWG ratings)
* Is it satisfying to use?

&#x200B;

Let‚Äôs start with the first cleanser I ever purchased, the **Muji Face Soap Scrub**. I found this for around $6 CAD at Muji. Being a total AB newbie, I picked it up not thinking much about the [ingredients](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8ef424943.html). It has peach pit particles which are supposed to exfoliate your skin. This sounds a bit like the infamous St. Ives apricot scrub LOL.

Unfortunately this cleanser has a pH of 7.5. Although it worked well to clean my face, and didn‚Äôt break me out, once I found out about the importance of using a low pH cleanser, I began my hunt for one. And thus begins the saga of me purchasing too many cleansers.

>pH balanced? No. Although at a 7.5 it isn‚Äôt as horrendous as I had estimated before I tested it, it should not be basic. Thank you, next!  
>  
>non-drying? Yes.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? Yes, if you live in a place where Muji has physical stores.  
>  
>safe ingredients? This product has many acne triggers on Cosdna.   
>  
>satisfying? heck yes i‚Äôm ashamed. Unscented aka slight chemical scent.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next, I purchased the **Cosrx Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser**. It seems to be very popular. I bought it for $22 on Amazon Canada. Unfortunately, the first time I tried it, it broke me out on my forehead. This was around September. I persisted with it for around two weeks before admitting that it was breaking me out. To this day I still don‚Äôt know exactly what it was. I‚Äôve heard Coco-Betaine was an irritant, or it could be the tea tree oil, but I‚Äôve used other products with these ingredients and my skin was fine with those.

>pH balanced? Yes  
>  
>non-drying? Not really. While it wasn‚Äôt the most drying cleanser I used, my skin felt slightly irritated and dry.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? Meh. It‚Äôs available everywhere but isn‚Äôt very cheap.    
>

&#x200B;

After the disaster that was Cosrx, I went for the **Heimish All Clean Green Foam**. It has a pH of 5.5 and comes in gel format. All I can say was, thank GOODNESS I went for the travel size!! This cleanser did not break me out, but it DRIED THE BEJEEZUS out of my skin. Seriously, ten seconds after cleansing, my forehead looked like roof shingles. Even after three layers of moisturizer my skin was still flaking. Good riddance.

>pH balanced? Yes.  
>  
>non-drying? hah. hahahah. hhhhhhh. hahaha.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? Decent, a little more expensive than Cosrx.  
>  
>safe	 ingredients? [Yes](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_d8f5360830.html). This one has all green from Cosdna which just shows that product safety ratings don‚Äôt mean your skin will like the product.  
>  
>satisfying? More than the Cosrx, but still not very foamy. :( Smells like grass.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Next, I bought the **Etude House Soonjung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser**. I really liked this one, so much that I used too much and nearly finished half a 70 mL bottle in two weeks. *Ooops*. This is really effective at removing makeup and sunscreen though it will sting your eyes. In fact, all of these cleansers will sting your eyes. I used to use two pumps every morning and night, which was waaaay too much. One pump is enough.

>pH balanced? Yes. Could be a bit lower but oh well.  
>  
>non-drying? Yes.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? $10 USD for 150 mL on [rubyrubyshop.com](https://rubyrubyshop.com). It‚Äôs not the easiest to find in store though. In Toronto, I‚Äôve seen it for $20 CAD at M Brand.  
>  
>safe ingredients? [Yes](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_ace9345797.html)!  
>  
>satisfying? it is a light foam. I like it a lot. It‚Äôs also unscented!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I also tried the **Hada Labo Gokujyun Hyaluronic Acid Cleansing Foam**. I really wanted to enjoy this, but unfortunately it left my skin dry and dull. What a shame, it was so cheap too. T\_T I‚Äôm using it as hand soap and shampoo now LOL. I did adore the texture of this, it is a very thick creamy foam.

>pH balanced? Yes, reported as approx 5.5.  
>  
>non-drying? others have said so. My skin didn‚Äôt agree, unfortunately.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? Yes, I‚Äôd buy the refills off doko demo for approx $10 each with air shipping (5-9 days) if it had worked for me.  
>  
>safe ingredients? [Pretty much](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_c05c170018.html). Only flag was PEG-8.  
>  
>satisfying? Yeeeeeeeeeees <3

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Finally, I‚Äôm currently trying the **Innisfree Blueberry Rebalancing 5.5 Cleanser.** I bought it today and only used it once so my opinions on it are tentative. It has a very heavy scent, kind of like if I walked into muji and soaked myself in their scent diffusers. It comes out as a cream and becomes a slight creamy foam. Similar level of foaming to the Cosrx but it‚Äôs a bit creamier.

>pH balanced? Yep!  
>  
>non-drying? Yes! This one left my skin really soft.  
>  
>affordability and convenience? Very cheap online, though not available in many sites like the Cosrx. I found it for $8.50 in store.  
>  
>safe ingredients? it‚Äôs all green on [cosdna](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_9fec221077.html). It does contain essential oils and isopropyl alcohol at the bottom of the list though.  
>  
>satisfying? Not as much as the Hada Labo or Soonjung.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Overall, which cleanser would I go with? Probably the Soonjung or Innisfree.** I wish the Innisfree were unscented, then it would be perfect. The soonjung has a slightly higher cleansing power than innisfree, so it is a tad more stripping but still not drying. If you don‚Äôt have oily skin, stay away from the Heimish.

&#x200B;

I think I‚Äôm done trying cleansers, whew! I was considering trying Innisfree the Minimum Cleanser but it‚Äôs a bit hard to find and only comes in a 70 mL size. Other cleansers I‚Äôve looked at are the Sulwhasoo Snowise Cleanser, and the Krave Matcha Hemp Hydrating Cleanser.

**Tosowoong Enzyme Powder Cleanser** \- I actually liked this for quite a while. It wasn't as stripping as the first two, but I learned that it contained sulfates, which kind of put me off from it.

mzo5es,Innisfree Mini Jeju Cherry Blossom review,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"One thing to note is that they all have a very very strong sweet and floral scent that resembles cherry blossom. 

ùôáùô§ùô©ùôûùô§ùô£:
‚Ä¢ Lovely sweet and floral scent
‚Ä¢ Lotion texture and soaks into my skin
‚Ä¢ Didn't leave my skin oily or progressively greasier throughout the day
‚Ä¢ Provided a subtle moisturising layer
‚Ä¢ Fragrance is too strong (even for me, who loves scents)

‚Ä¢ I finished using a full size of this before and it's amazing
‚Ä¢ I guess you can compare it to the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel as both has fragrance but are gel like and hydrating
‚Ä¢ Perfect for oilier skin types
‚Ä¢Hydrating but lightweight
‚Ä¢ Completely see through and jelly-gel like. Exactly as you would think (almost like aloe vera)
‚Ä¢ Somehow I can bear the fragrance in this!

ùôèùô§ùô£ùôö ùôêùô• ùòæùôßùôöùôñùô¢:
‚Ä¢ Thicker and more occlusive (locks in all the moisture you applied underneath)
‚Ä¢ Suitable for dryer skin types
‚Ä¢ I wish they had one without the ""tone-up"" aspect as it has quite a nice texture
‚Ä¢ The ""tone-up"" feature makes your skin appear more pale and lighter with the intent to even out your skin tone and maybe cover some redness.

1ksmlq0,Innisfree Retinol Cica Ampoule photo review,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"Skin type: Oily

Climate: Humid and breezy

I picked up this super cute My Melody collab version! üíñ

To take photos for this review, I think I ended up using almost two weeks' worth of product 
Since it's a retinol product, I was a little nervous at first, but it turns out it's a low concentration (0.015%), which makes it beginner friendly! Once your skin adjusts, I think you could definitely move on to something stronger.

I started with a teeny tiny amount and used it three times a week.
Out of all the skincare I‚Äôve tried, this one showed the most noticeable results. My skin felt smoother, and I finally understood what people mean when they say their skin ""glows""! If this is how effective low strength retinol is, I can't wait to see what higher concentrations do.
The texture is super watery and pale yellow. Since you only use a little at a time, it‚Äôs not moisturizing on its own, so make sure to follow up with a good hydrating cream.

Great for beginners! But even if it‚Äôs low strength, I‚Äôd still recommend a patch test if you have sensitive skin.

edoch1,[Discussion] Best of Innisfree?,Innisfree,AsianBeauty,"I really like the Innisfree Skinny Waterproof Microcara. It made my short and sparse asian eyelashes look fuller and longer. The tiny wand makes it so much easier to apply. It doesn't clump and is pretty waterproof (I wore it when I got married and I cried a lot- there was only the tiniest amount of smudging). The Innisfree mascara line was recently revamped though, so I'm hoping they didn't change the formula. Keeping my fingers crossed!

The Innisfree Jeju Volcanic Pore Clay Mask Original is also another favourite. It makes my skin feel less oily overall, and it makes my pores/sebaceous filaments look smaller/cleaner. Although I'm also interested in the Innisfree Super Volcanic Pore Clay Mask 2X. Does anyone know how they compare to each other? 

I also like the Innisfree Jeju Orchid Eye Cream. It's pretty moisturizing and doesn't irritate my eyes. But it's not as good as before they reformulated it (when the product name didn't have ""Jeju"" in the name and it came in a purple jar with white font instead of the current purple font).

No matter you skin type this moisturizer is amazing and it smells so nice as well, kind of citrusy and herbally at the same time.

I haven't used the other products mentioned, but I am also a huge fan of the Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence from CosRX. I started using this to help fade some acne scarring I had and it has done wonders for both the scarring and the overall tone of my skin, everything just looks much more even and is so smooth. This doesn't work overnight and isn't going to be a miracle worker but overtime it really helps with fading of discoloration and the overall tone of your skin. 

Everything I have tried from CosRX outside of the centella blemish cream has been great. Not a fan of that cream though, it doesn't do anything for me and just smells... Off. Like paint or something. 

If you have sensitive skin and need a BHA alternative suggestion for the CosRX ones, I suggest the Aloe BHA Skin Toner from Benton. It's all natural and is mostly Aloe Leaf water but there's a small amount of salicylic acid in it which with daily use can help prevent breakouts while also being very moisturizing. It contains hyaluronic acid and snail mucin so it's a fantastic option for a toner, again it's not going to be life changing and you won't see drastic results overnight but overtime it has reduced the amount of breakouts I have experienced, even causing my monthly hormonal acne to play nice and not be as large and imposing as it once was.",someone sensitive dehydrated skin begin tell amazing oil free moisturizer matter skin type moisturizer amazing smells nice well kind citrusy herbally time used products mentioned also huge fan galactomyces tone balancing essence cosrx started using help fade acne scarring done wonders scarring overall tone skin everything looks much even smooth work overnight going miracle worker overtime really helps fading discoloration overall tone skin everything tried cosrx outside centella blemish cream great fan cream though anything smells like paint something sensitive skin need bha alternative suggestion cosrx ones suggest aloe bha skin toner benton natural mostly aloe leaf water small amount salicylic acid daily use help prevent breakouts also moisturizing contains hyaluronic acid snail mucin fantastic option toner going life changing see drastic results overnight overtime reduced amount breakouts experienced even causing monthly hormonal acne play nice large imposing

I'm actually using the CosrRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid and it's pretty much cleared the cystic acne I had gotten. It literally flattened out the bumps overnight. Used it in my evening routine, woke up, the bumps on my face were waaaaaay flatter. It also hasn't made my skin get overly dry, unlike a lot of other BHAs. I don't want to overexfoliate my skin, but I really feel like I could use the power liquid every day with no issue. I'm trying to work up to that.

Pimple patches - These wouldnt stay on my face. The ones from Peach Slices work better for me. (Not those damn microneedle patches though, fuck them!! Thought I grabbed the usual pack, went to put one on, scared myself when it started stabbing my pimple üòµ)

Hyaluronic acid essence - this literally did nothing. Felt no difference at all in my skin. Went through 1 and 1/2 bottles and won't repurchase. Its really sticky too.

Snail eye cream - Had high hopes for this with all the peptides. It feels nice applying it but have not noticed any improvements with the skin under my eyes. Will not repurchase.

Poreless Power Liquid - I have a love hate with this one. It seems to help sebum production for me but felt I saw not much difference with whiteheads and I can't use it consecutively because it makes my skin flake. I think if they made like mini bottles I would repurchase it but I don't think buying another big bottle of this would be in my favor lol...

* COSRX Galactomyces 95% Facial Essence
* SKIN1004 - Madagascar Centella Ampoule
* Dr.Ceuracle - Cica Regen Waterproof Sun

i swapped out my usual round lab sunscreen for the Dr. Ceuracle one because i feel like sweat has been causing the round lab sunscreen to run off easily, so i opted for something waterproof this summer. for the first two weeks, I worked in the COSRX facial essence and started to see a rather quick turnaround in brightening, but i also tend to lose tans pretty quickly, so maybe that was what was actually happening. for the last two weeks, i've included the SKIN1004 madagascar centella ampoule, which has been really nice and given a noticeable bounce to my skin.

i'll keep this rotation up for another month, after which i'll start with some peptides to hopefully enter benjamin button territory and help with aging (38yo M)

zppiu1,Thoughts on COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence?,COSRX,AsianBeauty,"This product has been reviewed to death on many platforms (just do a search on this sub/ youtube/ tiktok/ etc.) and it's quite polarizing.

In short, people either hate it because the texture is so goopy/ sticky that it doesn't absorb, or love it because the goopy-ness ""melts"" into a hydrating water-like texture that's refreshing and satisfying to apply. This isn't an issue with the ingredients, purely the texture and overall user experience. Kind of like Laneige's Cream Skin Refiner where people either hate it or love it for the unique texture.

I'm personally in the latter category, which is why it's been one of the staples in my routine for a while. It doesn't fade acne scars as well as it claims, but it's still great at soothing and hydrating the skin. Can other products be just as hydrating? ...Yes. But for that price point it's still pretty darn good.

i61688,Innisfree My Lip Balm swatches + reviews,Glossier,KoreanBeauty,"Innisfree Lip Balm review:

I purchased the Mini My Lip Balm set which came with six mini lip balms (mint, vanilla, lemon, cherry, rose, and berry). I also received a full-size mint earl grey lip balm as part of the wonder box promotional sale. For reference, I'm very pale with neutral-leaning-cool undertones (~ NW13). Overall thoughts at the end. 

Green Peppermint Tea: Clear lip balm. No glittery shimmer, but a fair bit of shine. The mint smell is quite strong, and unfortunately I dislike the smell of mint. Probably my least favorite.

Sky Vanilla Tea: Comes out of the tube pastel blue but turns to a sheer light baby pink on the skin. Absolutely heavenly birthday cake smell. Just adds a subtle boost to my natural lip color.

Homemade Lemon Tea: Comes out of the tube pastel yellow but turns to a sheer warm light pink on the skin. I completely adore the sweet lemon scent. Another one that subtly boosts natural lip color, but with a warmer tone. Possibly my favorite. 

Mint Earl Grey: Soft peachy pink color. Just described as peach on the website but pulls a bit cooler on me. I love the subtle sweet scent but can't pick out what it is (not at all minty like the name suggests). A step up from natural-looking lip color, but still very subtle. Like an enhanced version of my lip color. Also possibly my favorite.

Sunkissed Cherry Tea: Bolder reddish pink color. Not ""neon red"" like it says on the website but definitely more intense than the other colors. The scent was very very subtle, almost undetectable. Though that's a good thing for me because I don't care for cherry scent. 

Dried Rose Tea: Warm reddish-pink color with a touch of coral. Not quite ""red tangerine"" as it's described online, but still a lovely shade. The rose scent is pleasant and not overly sweet, more like refreshing rosewater. I could probably build this color to be more intense with another layer. 

Very Berry Tea: A rich cool berry shade, although less purple than I expect to see in berry-colored lip products. More like berry-influenced pink. Pleasant berry scent, very much like berry scented chapsticks I had as a kid. Unfortunately, this one has a defect. When I squeezed the product tube for the first time to apply it, there was a popping sound and the tube deflated. It seems that it was filled mostly with air rather than product by accident. I would be very irritated if I'd bought a full size version, but it's a mini and not even close to my favorite so it's just mildly disappointing. 

Overall/general thoughts: I love these lip balms! The scents are lovely and the colors are very wearable on a daily basis. The formula is very smooth and glides onto the skin easily. It's also quite hydrating for a good couple hours, and the tint lasts long after the shine fades which is a cool feature I haven't noticed in American lip balms. I would definitely repurchase vanilla, lemon, and mint earl grey. Maybe rose or cherry as well for a good red color. I also really want to try wild hibiscus, ruby grapefruit tea, and wedding peach tea in the future. 

Compared to Glossier balm dotcom: I've frequently seen these lip balms compared to the Glossier balm dotcoms or suggested as dupes. I only have the cherry balm dotcom, but I would have to agree that these are a great alternative. The glossier balm is much more difficult to fully apply to the skin, I think because it's more of a solid vaseline-esque formula than a smooth balm. Overall, it feels less hydrating, less long-lasting, and stickier than the innisfree lip balms. I also HATE the strong cherry scent of the Glossier product. That said, I don't think there's a perfect match between the Glossier shades and the innisfree shades, though you can probably find fairly close matches for most. Glossier has more variety of clear scents if that's what you prefer. Innisfree is a bit cheaper if you buy individually, but the same price per product if you buy the Glossier balm dotcom trio. Maybe I should try more balm dotcom shades, but as of now I strongly prefer Innisfree.",innisfree lip balm review purchased mini lip balm set came six mini lip balms mint vanilla lemon cherry rose berry also received full size mint earl grey lip balm part wonder box promotional sale reference pale neutral leaning cool undertones nw overall thoughts end green peppermint tea clear lip balm glittery shimmer fair bit shine mint smell quite strong unfortunately dislike smell mint probably least favorite sky vanilla tea comes tube pastel blue turns sheer light baby pink skin absolutely heavenly birthday cake smell adds subtle boost natural lip color homemade lemon tea comes tube pastel yellow turns sheer warm light pink skin completely adore sweet lemon scent another one subtly boosts natural lip color warmer tone possibly favorite mint earl grey soft peachy pink color described peach website pulls bit cooler love subtle sweet scent pick minty like name suggests step natural looking lip color still subtle like enhanced version lip color also possibly favorite sunkissed cherry tea bolder reddish pink color neon red like says website definitely intense colors scent subtle almost undetectable though good thing care cherry scent dried rose tea warm reddish pink color touch coral quite red tangerine described online still lovely shade rose scent pleasant overly sweet like refreshing rosewater could probably build color intense another layer berry tea rich cool berry shade although less purple expect see berry colored lip products like berry influenced pink pleasant berry scent much like berry scented chapsticks kid unfortunately one defect squeezed product tube first time apply popping sound tube deflated seems filled mostly air rather product accident would irritated bought full size version mini even close favorite mildly disappointing overall general thoughts love lip balms scents lovely colors wearable daily basis formula smooth glides onto skin easily also quite hydrating good couple hours tint lasts long shine fades cool feature noticed american lip balms would definitely repurchase vanilla lemon mint earl grey maybe rose cherry well good red color also really want try wild hibiscus ruby grapefruit tea wedding peach tea future compared glossier balm dotcom frequently seen lip balms compared glossier balm dotcoms suggested dupes cherry balm dotcom would agree great alternative glossier balm much difficult fully apply skin think solid vaseline esque formula smooth balm overall feels less hydrating less long lasting stickier innisfree lip balms also hate strong cherry scent glossier product said think perfect match glossier shades innisfree shades though probably find fairly close matches glossier variety clear scents prefer innisfree bit cheaper buy individually price per product buy glossier balm dotcom trio maybe try balm dotcom shades strongly prefer innisfree

Have a look at Cosrx instead. Their Good Morning gel cleanser is good. Their mucin power  essence is great if you're not sensitive to it and you're ok with the concept of snail mucin. There isn't really a 'bad' product across their brand.

Innisfree just did a whole rebrand/reformulation across the ranges that I'm yet to get my head around. The internet seems to hate it so far.

foqa0z,"What is the best product for each of these brands: Sulwhasoo, History of Whoo, Su:m37",Sulwhasoo,KoreanBeauty,"I've tried numerous products from these lines. I'm a 30yo male with dry and semi sensitive skin. My major concerns are hydration and fine lines.

My current routine contains a lot of products from these lines:

* Whoo - Jinyulhyang Essential Cleansing Oil
* Whoo - Cheongidan Radiant Cleansing Foam
* Son and Park - Beauty Water (At night to help remove any remaining makeup)
* Neogen - Bio Peel Wine (2x per week - Night)
* Sulwhasoo - First Care Activating Serum
* Su:m37 - Losec Summa Elixir Skin Softener
* Whoo - HwanYu Signature Ampoule
* Whoo - HwanYu Essence (Day)
* Cosrx - Snail Mucin Essence (Night)
* It's Skin - Power 10 LI Effector (Day)
* Missha - Time Revolution Night Repair Bobarit Ampoule (Night)
* Su:m37 - Losec Summa Elixir Emulsion
* Whoo - HwanYu Cream (Day)
* Sulwhasoo - Concentrated Ginseng Cream (Night)
* Neogen - Day Light Sun Protection Sunscreen (Day)
* Sulwhasoo - Overnight Vitalizing Mask (Night)

Here are the ones I've liked the most:

Sulwhasoo:

* First Care Activating Serum - one of those products that has seemed to improve how my skin looks and feels regardless of which other products I put on top of it.
* Concentrated Ginseng Cream - so many incredible ingredients all in one product. Has a strong ginseng scent (which I like) and applies very easily. Noticed an immediate difference in my skin texture after use.
* Overnight Vitalizing Mask - Probably my HG overnight mask. My skin always looks incredible in the mornings following the use of this product.

History of Whoo: 

* Cheongidan radiant cleansing foam - my current foam cleanser. Gentle, but had a strong fragrance. My skin still feels hydrated after use.
* HwanYu signature ampoule - super pricy, but super luxurious. Has a very sticky texture but doesn't leave my skin feeling tacky. This product has taken my glow levels to an extreme. One pump is all you need!
* HwanYu eye cream - Incredible texture. Dries down wonderfully and seems to brighten my under eye area. A little goes a long way! Light enough for day use. My current eye cream.

Su:m37: 

* Losec Summa Skin Softener - a very hydrating toner, and my current toner. Has a slight citrus scent, but applies easily and absorbs quickly. Semi thick consistency.
* Losec Summa Emulsion - my current emulsion. Incredibly hydrating, and seems to aid in the application of my moisturizer. Strong citrus scent.
* Losec Summa Cream - Very nice and bouncy cream. Absorbs well, and locks in my other products.

I am looking into the Secret and Flawless lines from Su:m37, so I hope they provide the same quality as the losec summa lines! I would really like to try the secret repair masks!

Hopefully this is helpful!

167pzig,Why Etude house is cheap when their products are great ?,Sulwhasoo,KoreanBeauty,"Part of it is the cost of research. Korea is big on beauty to the point that there is a plethora of labs that have tested base formulas, which brands buy and tweak. Another aspect is American products spend more on diversity, so they spend more to formulate things for a wider range of skin tones. Korean brands have a limited scope.

Tone up creams are used to even your uneven skin tone and also to lighten your dark foundations.

183ifqn,Nc44 Fenty 330 eyeshadow palette recommendations,Fenty,BrownBeauty,"I'm the same skintone as you and my go-to neutrals with a little bit of glam palette is colourpop's wild child, it's all different shades of brown ranging from gold-ish to red-ish to dark copper and burgundy. There are shimmers and mattes and it performs really well on darker skin, it's one of my favorites for either a regular day look or a more glammed up vibe. 

One thing I will say is that there are 9 colours in this palette but I only use 8 of them. The middle colour is a pressed glitter and I don't use glitters due to the fear that it may tear my eye parts, so I just pulled the glitter pan out. I still really like it without that pan and I think it's really cohesive anyways. 

Another really nice one is colourpop's eyeshadow quad in sparkler, this has 4 shades, two shimmery golds (the lighter one is more sparse and meant to be a topper) and two brown mattes (one medium tone and the other a lot deeper). If you use one or two colours it's a nice neutral look, but using all 4 creates a really pretty, brown glam look. I like this one when I don't want to think too much about what look I want to do lol.",skintone go neutrals little bit glam palette colourpop wild child different shades brown ranging gold ish red ish dark copper burgundy shimmers mattes performs really well darker skin one favorites either regular day look glammed vibe one thing say colours palette use middle colour pressed glitter use glitters due fear may tear eye parts pulled glitter pan still really like without pan think really cohesive anyways another really nice one colourpop eyeshadow quad sparkler shades two shimmery golds lighter one sparse meant topper two brown mattes one medium tone lot deeper use one two colours nice neutral look using creates really pretty brown glam look like one want think much look want lol

As far as the actual shades, there's a ridiculous variety. I am med dark indian and there were 3 that fit me ok, and one that was basically my perfect match.

Matching at sephora? Even though I like the employees at sephora, as most of them are very nice to me, I would say ask for a sample and take it home before you buy. The reason for this is that the lighting in Sephora is bad and the color iq tool they use can be kinda off some times. Additionally the fenty foundation specifically has been known to get darker when it dries down.",worth hype personally like dewier foundations nah definitley see people like wary dry skin far actual shades ridiculous variety med dark indian fit ok one basically perfect match matching sephora even though like employees sephora nice would say ask sample take home buy reason lighting sephora bad color iq tool use kinda times additionally fenty foundation specifically known get darker dries
7he9a9,Fenty or nah?,Fenty,BrownBeauty,"Mixed girl here too! From my experience, the color IQ doesn‚Äôt work that well (it chooses a shade that‚Äôs too red) and the employees here don‚Äôt really want to help so it‚Äôs usually a process for me. I decide what foundation I want to try, look online for swatches to get an idea of what range I‚Äôm in (ex: early 300s in Fenty) and I‚Äôll look at YouTubers that have a review for the shades that I think match me best. These are extra steps I take to cut my time at Sephora, especially when I‚Äôm looking at multiple foundations. When I‚Äôm at Sephora, I‚Äôll swatch those shades and request samples for them so I can see how it works for me. Unfortunately, I purchased Fenty and had to return it. I swatched 300, 310, 330. (320 wasn‚Äôt there.) 330 was a good match but I knew about the oxidation so I went for 310. I would have chosen 300 but the undertone seemed a little different compared to the other two. The finish was gorgeous; it was semi-matte, the coverage is medium to full, and it made my skin look flawless but natural. I could also see that it was darkening a little bit within 5-10 minutes. It wasn‚Äôt bad until 6 hours later. My face was around 4 shades darker and leaning orange. I have oily skin and I only had to touch up twice and the foundation didn‚Äôt separate at all but the oxidation made me return it. I was so upset because it is a good foundation but it didn‚Äôt work for me. Some people like it and some people don‚Äôt so I still recommend that you should request samples so you can try it out for yourself but with keeping the oxidation in mind because I feel that my oily skin may have contributed to it oxidizing so badly and it could work well for those with normal or maybe dry skin if you use moisturizer before applying it.",mixed girl experience color iq work well chooses shade red employees really want help usually process decide foundation want try look online swatches get idea range ex early fenty look youtubers review shades think match best extra steps take cut time sephora especially looking multiple foundations sephora swatch shades request samples see works unfortunately purchased fenty return swatched good match knew oxidation went would chosen undertone seemed little different compared two finish gorgeous semi matte coverage medium full made skin look flawless natural could also see darkening little bit within minutes bad hours later face around shades darker leaning orange oily skin touch twice foundation separate oxidation made return upset good foundation work people like people still recommend request samples try keeping oxidation mind feel oily skin may contributed oxidizing badly could work well normal maybe dry skin use moisturizer applying
7he9a9,Fenty or nah?,Fenty,BrownBeauty,"Hmm As much as I am thankful for Fenty's amazing range of undertones, the foundation is hard to match online because of the minuscule variances in shades.

It is not great for dry skin.

It is not the best for flash photography at night, although photographs beautifully in natural light.

I like the price point, it's decent, lower than most others by a little.

Do not blind buy. Look up youtubers in your skin tone range. Almost everyone has made fenty foundation videos. Then get samples of 3 shades that you think are in your range.

I have 330 & 350 because they both match me somehow, 330 is a tad lighter but I can still wear it in winter with bronzer. 350 works for my summer skin tone.

I like the foundation but I don't reach for it too often.

If you are really looking for a great easy to wear foundation, there are other options that you can look into. I really enjoy the Smashbox Face Shaping stick. It's medium coverage, blends easily. It's got an ok shade range. I'm 3.2 in that.

Also check out MUFE foundation sticks, they are are also excellent.

In terms of formula for their matte shades, they‚Äôre very very powdery and has a lot of kickback in the pan. They‚Äôre okay to work with, but there are eyeshadows from other brands I‚Äôd prefer. 

The colours are VERY warm. I always thought I was warm undertone, which is why I bought this palette, but after realising that all my foundations went orange on me (including NC42 by Mac), I realised I‚Äôm actually olive with a cool yellow undertone. Because of this, neutral palettes work better on my skintone (Tarte Bloom palette) for everyday looks.

b72es3,Lorac Pro vs. Tarte Toasted for a Desi girl with NC42-ish skin?,Tarte,BrownBeauty,"The Lorac Pro 1 and tarte toasted are both great palettes for different purposes. I have both. 

Lorac Pro is one of those staple, everyday palettes. It has both warm and cool tone colors and I've personally been able to use it for both day time and night time looks. it's incredibly versatile and the quality is one that I frankly haven't seen anywhere else. I can't speak for the other Lorac pallets though. The first Lorac Pro is an older palette, sort of like the first Naked, so it's not as hyped up but I would still recommend it. It's definitely a holy Grail for me.

As for Tarte toasted palette, it's also very good but it is obviously all warm tones on the reddish brownish gold side, and while that's all good and fun, if you're looking to switch things up with some mauves or taupes or something cooler, you won't be able to do that with this palette. However if you are largely a fan of those reddish brownish colors, then Tarte toasted may be your best option  The quality is great, though I still prefer Lorac's formula. As for comparisons with Naked Heat and Tarte Toasted, yes it is is very comparable... I would say Naked Heat's formula is amazing, very high quality, but I found it was just too bold and red and I was looking for a more toned down version of their colors, which is exactly what Tarte toasted provided. 


Overall I'm more of a fan of Lorac Pro, there's more versatility in the colors and the quality is amazing... but if you're more of a warm tones fan then Tarte may be a better option.",lorac pro tarte toasted great palettes different purposes lorac pro one staple everyday palettes warm cool tone colors personally able use day time night time looks incredibly versatile quality one frankly seen anywhere else speak lorac pallets though first lorac pro older palette sort like first naked hyped would still recommend definitely holy grail tarte toasted palette also good obviously warm tones reddish brownish gold side good fun looking switch things mauves taupes something cooler able palette however largely fan reddish brownish colors tarte toasted may best option quality great though still prefer lorac formula comparisons naked heat tarte toasted yes comparable would say naked heat formula amazing high quality found bold red looking toned version colors exactly tarte toasted provided overall fan lorac pro versatility colors quality amazing warm tones fan tarte may better option

kucpn6,e.l.f eye productsswatches + reviews,e.l.f.,IndianSkincareAddicts,"So after a quick trip to the local mall for groceries, my makeup loving self + curiosity induced made a stop at the nykaa store to check out elf cosmetics. I ve heard much about the prices being on the higher side on nykaa, despite elfs appeal to be drugstore.

So since nykaa is having a 20% off on all elf products, which significantly reduces the cost too, for all you curious people out there :

I wanted an affordable eyeliner for all the upcoming weddings I have this year:

From top to bottom: ( please ignore the lone liner swatch  at the far left)

Elf intense ink eyeliner ( blackest black) : A sturdy thick pen with a good thick line. Probably make the quickest to draw a classic eyeliner style if you're in a rush. 
Undiscounted Cost : Rs 600

Elf precision liquid eyeliner : nothing precise about this one. Looked really streaky and the lines didn't come out fine at all.
Undiscounted Cost : Rs 600

Elf expert liquid liner : This was actually a nic looking brush tipped liner to draw for those who prefer liners to pens. In my opinion, the lines still smudged a bit, but am no expert in eyeliner. Someone with a good hand can make it work.
Undiscounted price : Rs 400

Elf eyeliner pen ( black): this was clearly the best. Fine, matte black, pigmented and the clear winner. The one I purchased too.
Undiscounted Cost : Rs 400

Elf eyeshadow products :

I really liked bright yellow gold ( think fenty beauty) liquid eyeshadow in 24K gold. It has a foil glitter look, but I loved it. Really pigmented and great on all skin tones. Perfect for them Indian weddings. I could do an entire eye look in minutes with this eyeshadow.
( I have also ordered the deep blue liquid eyeshadow in ""ocean eyes"" swatched below the gold) 

The palettes had decent pigmentation but lesser staying power, but at Rs 400 it's fine for beginners who want to try / learn eye makeup look or people who rarely wear eye makeup and want an affordable palette for special nights.

So, final review : 20% off definitely makes it more appealing. The eye products seemed more worth it and affordable than the rest of the line.",quick trip local mall groceries makeup loving self curiosity induced made stop nykaa store check elf cosmetics heard much prices higher side nykaa despite elfs appeal drugstore since nykaa elf products significantly reduces cost curious people wanted affordable eyeliner upcoming weddings year top bottom please ignore lone liner swatch far left elf intense ink eyeliner blackest black sturdy thick pen good thick line probably make quickest draw classic eyeliner style rush undiscounted cost rs elf precision liquid eyeliner nothing precise one looked really streaky lines come fine undiscounted cost rs elf expert liquid liner actually nic looking brush tipped liner draw prefer liners pens opinion lines still smudged bit expert eyeliner someone good hand make work undiscounted price rs elf eyeliner pen black clearly best fine matte black pigmented clear winner one purchased undiscounted cost rs elf eyeshadow products really liked bright yellow gold think fenty beauty liquid eyeshadow k gold foil glitter look loved really pigmented great skin tones perfect indian weddings could entire eye look minutes eyeshadow also ordered deep blue liquid eyeshadow ocean eyes swatched gold palettes decent pigmentation lesser staying power rs fine beginners want try learn eye makeup look people rarely wear eye makeup want affordable palette special nights final review definitely makes appealing eye products seemed worth affordable rest line

xqahnc,Two Week Review- Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask,Laneige,IndianSkincareAddicts,"I have read somewhere that it's a sleeping mask, so you should apply a balm first and on top apply this mask for effective results.

xqahnc,Two Week Review- Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask,Laneige,IndianSkincareAddicts,"Laneige lip mask didn‚Äôt work out for me either for a very long time and this 8g tub was a pain to finish. 
I know we are like supposed to put skincare on lips as well but i was always so lazy But one night I decided to put it onto my lips as well after taking a bath before bed. So it goes like- 

‚Ä¢ damp skin and lips

‚Ä¢ apply hydrating toner or HA on lips

‚Ä¢ apply a dot of moisturiser to lips 

‚Ä¢ top it off with a very thin layer of vaseline 

‚Ä¢ after a few minutes i apply the sleeping mask and go to sleep. 

I did this and haven‚Äôt looked back since. It works so so much better. And not just with sleeping mask with any lip balm. 
If your lips are flaky and dry af, u can try a sugar scrub or just use your regular toothbrush while brushing, on your lips (works for me). 

If Vaseline and lip masks don‚Äôt work out then, scrub your lips and put ghee or a thick layer of cream. This one really works so well! Lips become so soft by morning.",laneige lip mask work either long time g tub pain finish know like supposed put skincare lips well always lazy one night decided put onto lips well taking bath bed goes like damp skin lips apply hydrating toner ha lips apply dot moisturiser lips top thin layer vaseline minutes apply sleeping mask go sleep looked back since works much better sleeping mask lip balm lips flaky dry af u try sugar scrub use regular toothbrush brushing lips works vaseline lip masks work scrub lips put ghee thick layer cream one really works well lips become soft morning

If you mention you have extreme dryness around the eyes pls avoid using eye creams esp those with a high concentration of, say, retinol. It‚Äôll dry it out further. 
You need to start by balancing the moisture in that region as well. Don‚Äôt ask me how, I‚Äôm no expert in this unfortunately. You‚Äôll have to do some research or technically stop using the thing that may be drying out that region. 

For dark circles, puffiness, etc (if you‚Äôre unable to stick to a sleep schedule, good diet and all) you can use any decent, well priced eye cream to reduce the _appearance_ of these. There is nothing in the market that gets rid of them, anything that claims to do so is false.

I'm not saying the corporates are saints. They will do anything do sell their products. The cruelty free becomes very normal now a days thanks to the customers who demanded that.

So right now, it's not the companies that we should voice out, but the laws of different countries. But I can't speak bad about the countries who are genuinely worried about their people's safety either.

In order for them to be cruelty free they need to stop letting even the third parties test on animals. Some of these companies even hire a third party lab to conduct these tests. 

How in the world is it cruelty free when your products are being tested on animals at the end of the day? It is
 not about the intent here but the end result. 

Laneige is not cruelty free until the company outright comes and says that they have stopped any kind of animal testing even by these third party labs and gets certified as one. Until then, their products are NOT CF.

Also,brands can find suppliers who do not test on animals. 

I know this because I have my own cruelty free and vegan business. It took me over a year to find trustworthy and ethical suppliers. I'm  just one person, doing all that research.

12fhoqh,Sulwhasoo Products Mini Reviews,Sulwhasoo,IndianSkincareAddicts,"My first time buying Sulwhasoo was out of curiosity in July 2021. There was an offer going on and they were giving 5ml ginseng cream, 15 ml each of toner and emulsion with 8ml of First Care Activating Serum (FCAS). When I bought the items I did not know much about Sulwhasoo or the hype. I fell in love with the FCAS and ginseng cream in 15 days that I tried them. I was heartbroken by the price point (specially for the ginseng cream, I love love love it). Researched more about the brand and got to know about the Overnight Vitalizing mask, found it to be priced well (it's now on the verge of being empty with almost daily use), so bought it during July Nykaa sale. I always always buy Sulwhasoo items during sale and that too when they have the best offers. Both the 60ml FCAS that you see in the pic are free items.

&#x200B;

Mini reviews:

Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum (FCAS) - I use this just after cleansing on slightly damp face. This gets absorbed fast and make the skin feel healthy with consistent use. It has a soothing smell which calms me down in a second.

Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Water - This is a thick toner which applies easily and feels good on skin. Norhing special about it, can be replaced by any other toner.

Sulwhasoo Essential Balancing Emulsion - Its like a lotion and can be applied as stand alone moisturizer when weather permits. Its a good emulsion to be followed by a moisturizer.

Sulwhasoo Essential Firming Cream - This is a day cream and works like any other cream. It gets absorbed fast and is not greasy. I didnt get to use it long to notice any skin firming benefits from this product alone.

Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum - Another serum from the brand, but I did not find it providing any additional benefit to my skin. Its easily skippable.

Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream - This is love!!! This feels so good when applied to the face. The aroma, the texture, the feel of this on the skin - all amazing. I use it as night cream and have felt a very good change in my skin with continued use of this cream. All my marks faded with its use. My skin feels plump and healthy. This is my Holy Grail!

Sulwhasoo Overnight Vitalizing Mask - This is another awesome product from Sulwhasoo. Its one of their affordable products and last a long time too. It has a whipped texture and slight gingery smell.

&#x200B;

I really enjoy my routine with Sulwhasoo products as it has such a calming effect on me because of the smell of the products.

The products from this brand have worked wonders for me. My face looks plump, healthy, glowing and any marks fade away quickly.

I got [this set - Sulwhasoo First Care Essentials Combo ](https://www.nykaa.com/sulwhasoo-first-care-essentials-combo/p/10840293?se=0) with an mrp of ‚Çπ6200 for ‚Çπ5500 post 700 rupees discount using the 15%off code. I picked 2 masks as freebies with my order. 

I'd been wanting something from sulwhasoo for a couple of years now, & despite seeing value sets every now & then they didn't always have a combo of products that I wanted. The estimated value of this set is ‚Çπ11,900. After including the freebies the total value of all the products is ‚Çπ14,400.

This is the best deal I've seen so far on any retailer, Kbeauty/International or Indian.

At 2.7x the value against what I paid, I find this to be a steal. The products also are quite decently sized.

- FCAS is 60ml which alone retails for 6200.

- Ginseng cream is 10ml which retails for 3500.
- Ginseng serum ex is 5ml with estimated value of 1450. (To put it in perspective, 15ml of this retails for 4500.)
- Cleansing oil is the cheapest at 50ml for 750. 
- White ginseng mask is 35ml valued at ‚Çπ1445. 
- Overnight Mask is also 35ml with value of ‚Çπ1050. 

Overall this is incredible value. I'm so excited to share this with everyone. If you keep track of sales & value sets & have patience it does pay off! üéâüéâüéâ

1alqqkn,Sulwhasoo first care activating serum review,Sulwhasoo,IndianSkincareAddicts,"Skin type: Dry skin

Climatic conditions: Pleasant/slightly hot during afternoon, not humid

Routine at the time of using the product :
LRP hydrating cleanser/isntree green tea cleanser,
Sulwhasoo FCAS
Cosrx propolis essence
Cosrx snail mucin
Laneige water bank moisture essence.
Moisturizer - pyunkang yul black tea/farmacy honey halo/skinfood propolis cream/emolene/klairs midnight blue serum

Sometimes i include few other serums/toner on few days based on needs:
Klairs activating youth drops or peptide or collagen based toner on hydration days
Any bha/aha toner on extoliation days along with niacinamide
Azelaic acid or retinol twice weekly.

I tend to make days specific to hydration vs exfoliation va targeted skin concern based on the need.

Age range - 30 F
Usage timeline : 5 days
Ingredient List :
 https://www.nykaa.com/sulwhasoo-first-care-activating-serum-ad/p/4626272?skuId=1491435&se=0

Texture, Consistency details: Watery, but not runny. Somewhat like an essence

Fragrance : Very slightly earthy smell, doesnt linger on at all!

Experience and thoughts in detail:
I didnt not expect this to do anything in 4-5 days honestly.
I hate that i love this product because its pricey ü•≤
This serum is supposed to enhance absorption of other skincare items in your routine and should be applied right after cleansing.
It literally made my skin ""smooth"" in some way, like blurred.

I could reaaalyy see the difference in my skin wrt radiance and glow.
Every morning i used to wake up with glass like looking skin.
This didnt help with any acne marks which i had (i dont think it claims to also?).
I thought it would take longer for me to see ANY results, but i was surprised honestly.

Holy Grail / Will Re-purchase: Sadly, yes.

If you want to try, buy a smaller size to see if it doesnt give any breakouts because this is expensive ü•≤",skin type dry skin climatic conditions pleasant slightly hot afternoon humid routine time using product lrp hydrating cleanser isntree green tea cleanser sulwhasoo fcas cosrx propolis essence cosrx snail mucin laneige water bank moisture essence moisturizer pyunkang yul black tea farmacy honey halo skinfood propolis cream emolene klairs midnight blue serum sometimes include serums toner days based needs klairs activating youth drops peptide collagen based toner hydration days bha aha toner extoliation days along niacinamide azelaic acid retinol twice weekly tend make days specific hydration vs exfoliation va targeted skin concern based need age range f usage timeline days ingredient list texture consistency details watery runny somewhat like essence fragrance slightly earthy smell doesnt linger experience thoughts detail didnt expect anything days honestly hate love product pricey serum supposed enhance absorption skincare items routine applied right cleansing literally made skin smooth way like blurred could reaaalyy see difference skin wrt radiance glow every morning used wake glass like looking skin didnt help acne marks dont think claims also thought would take longer see results surprised honestly holy grail purchase sadly yes want try buy smaller size see doesnt give breakouts expensive

13nso9d,Oily Acne Prone Skin Review for Innisfree Hyaluron Moist Sunscreen,Innisfree,IndianSkincareAddicts,"Skin type- Oily acne prone skin 

Climate- Hot and Humid Mumbai climate

Age- 20, Female

Current AM/ PM routine- 

AM- Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser, Plum Vitamic C Serum, Innisfree Hyaluron Moist Sunscreen

PM- Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm, Cetaphil Oily Skin Cleanser/ Minimalist 2% SA cleanser/ Saslic glow, Plum 10% Niacinamide serum, Minimalist ceramide moisturizer with Madecassosside for Oily skin 

Usage Timeline- Since 28th March (Almost 2 months) 

Ingredient List- Water,¬†Propanediol,¬†Dibutyl Adipate,¬†Polymethylsilsesquioxane,¬†Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate,¬†Diisopropyl Sebacate,¬†Ethylhexyl Triazone,¬†Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl Tetramethylbutylphenol,¬†Niacinamide,¬†Coco-Caprylate/‚ÄãCaprate,¬†Diethylhexyl Butamido Triazone,¬†Glycerin,¬†Butylene Glycol,¬†1,2-Hexanediol,¬†Caprylyl Methicone,¬†Pentylene Glycol,¬†Behenyl Alcohol,¬†Polyglyceryl-3 Methylglucose Distearate,¬†Poly C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate,¬†Decyl Glucoside,¬†Tromethamine,¬†Carbomer,¬†Acrylates/‚ÄãC10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer,¬†Panthenol,¬†Sodium Stearoyl Glutamate,¬†Polyacrylate Crosspolymer-6,¬†Ethylhexylglycerin,¬†Adenosine,¬†Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Oil,¬†Linalool,¬†Xanthan Gum,¬†T-Butyl Alcohol,¬†Madecassoside,¬†Allantoin,¬†Anthemis Nobilis Flower Oil,¬†*Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate,¬†Tocopherol,¬†Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract,¬†Propolis Extract,¬†Ethyl Ascorbyl Ether,¬†Houttuynia Cordata Extract,¬†*Sodium Hyaluronate,¬†*Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate,¬†*Hydrolyzed Hyaluronic Acid,¬†*Sodium Acetylated Hyaluronate,¬†*Hyaluronic Acid,¬†*Sodium Hyaluronate Crosspolymer,¬†*Potassium Hyaluronate (*Include Hyaluronic Complex 10Ppm)

Texture and Consistency- watery consistency, slightly runny. Very lightweight texture which blends within seconds. No white cast experienced. 

Fragrance- Artificial fragrance is present (linalool). Smells a little fevicol- ish but it's nothing bothersome. I don't find the added fragrance irritating either. 

Effect and result- like I mentioned it blends within seconds. It provides a lot of hydration and moisture on its own and I can skip moisturizer in the AM for my oily skin. It has simplified my skincare routine and saves me time. Gives adequate protection and lives up to its rating mentioned on the label. I don't think it's water resistant but it is sweat resistant to an extent. I don't sweat much so it's not an issue for me. 

Experience and thoughts in detail- This is hands down the most cosmetically elegant sunscreen I have used. It blends like a literal dream, no stinging the eyes or skin. Reapplication is also easy. It leaves a natural to dewy- ish finish. (Depends a lot on the weather of the day) On reapplication I find it a bit shiny sometimes so I settle that with compact. No white cast on reappication either.  Did not clog my pores either and cause acne. Skin did not feel oily/ heavy or congested. It's super lightweight. 

Any cons- Price point and added fragrance. I don't mind the added fragrance but that might be a problem for people with sensitive skin. And the sunscreen costs 1500 (I got it for 1350 on 10% discount on Nykaa). It's not as expensive as other K beauty sunscreena (like isntree) or other cosmetically elegant sunscreens (like Estee Lauder) so ig it's fine. I guess to find a sunscreen of this quality which actually gives proper protection as well, maybe this is the price we need to pay, but I also understand why it might not be feasible for all. 

Holy Grail, will repurchase. 

One more thing to note, I only use this when I'm going out bc it's expensive. When I'm indoors, I use the Plum green tea spf 35 or earlier I was using the Minimalist spf 50.",skin type oily acne prone skin climate hot humid mumbai climate age female current pm routine cetaphil oily skin cleanser plum vitamic c serum innisfree hyaluron moist sunscreen pm inkey list oat cleansing balm cetaphil oily skin cleanser minimalist sa cleanser saslic glow plum niacinamide serum minimalist ceramide moisturizer madecassosside oily skin usage timeline since th march almost months ingredient list water propanediol dibutyl adipate polymethylsilsesquioxane diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate diisopropyl sebacate ethylhexyl triazone methylene bis benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol niacinamide coco caprylate caprate diethylhexyl butamido triazone glycerin butylene glycol hexanediol caprylyl methicone pentylene glycol behenyl alcohol polyglyceryl methylglucose distearate poly c alkyl acrylate decyl glucoside tromethamine carbomer acrylates c alkyl acrylate crosspolymer panthenol sodium stearoyl glutamate polyacrylate crosspolymer ethylhexylglycerin adenosine lavandula angustifolia lavender oil linalool xanthan gum butyl alcohol madecassoside allantoin anthemis nobilis flower oil hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate tocopherol aloe barbadensis leaf extract propolis extract ethyl ascorbyl ether houttuynia cordata extract sodium hyaluronate hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid sodium acetylated hyaluronate hyaluronic acid sodium hyaluronate crosspolymer potassium hyaluronate include hyaluronic complex ppm texture consistency watery consistency slightly runny lightweight texture blends within seconds white cast experienced fragrance artificial fragrance present linalool smells little fevicol ish nothing bothersome find added fragrance irritating either effect result like mentioned blends within seconds provides lot hydration moisture skip moisturizer oily skin simplified skincare routine saves time gives adequate protection lives rating mentioned label think water resistant sweat resistant extent sweat much issue experience thoughts detail hands cosmetically elegant sunscreen used blends like literal dream stinging eyes skin reapplication also easy leaves natural dewy ish finish depends lot weather day reapplication find bit shiny sometimes settle compact white cast reappication either clog pores either cause acne skin feel oily heavy congested super lightweight cons price point added fragrance mind added fragrance might problem people sensitive skin sunscreen costs got discount nykaa expensive k beauty sunscreena like isntree cosmetically elegant sunscreens like estee lauder ig fine guess find sunscreen quality actually gives proper protection well maybe price need pay also understand might feasible holy grail repurchase one thing note use going bc expensive indoors use plum green tea spf earlier using minimalist spf

When I had pustules & cystic acne & even touching skin hurt, back then the only manual exfoliater I could use was Innisfree's wine peeling gel.

Now that my skin isn't as sensitive anymore, I use it after I use at home peel. It helps slough off all the dead skin that the chemical exfoliant loosened up. It's still great to use in conjuction with other products.

It doesn't smell like wine nor grapes in case you're curious.

Generally purging should give you extra acne in the same places you usually have. Because it is only supposed to bring out acne you‚Äôve would have had anyway faster. So did you already have acne in all these places? 

For example I only break out on my cheeks maybe chin sometimes but almost never on my forehead so if I see a lot of acne on my forehead after introducing a product it‚Äôs guaranteed to be irritation.
