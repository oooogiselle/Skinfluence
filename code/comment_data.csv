8qkw0m,Your skin looks great but the best part of this picture is your smile!,None,Estée Lauder,SkincareAddiction,0.9168,positive
8qkw0m,"Here is my Daily Routine:

In the AM/PM
1.) I use 3 pumps of the Clinique Take Off the Day Cleansing Oil (purple bottle) and rub it all over my face. This product can be used on all skin types so my oily friends don’t need to worry! 
2.) I wash the oil off my face with a warm wash cloth
3.) I then wash my face with a Caress Daily Silk Beauty Bar, for regular ol bar soap really cleanses my skin and is so gentle! 
3.) I dry my face with a towel and put on two drops of my Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair all over my face! A little bit goes a longgggg way! Plus I try to conserve it due to the priciness of the product! 
4.) Once that’s rubbed in I let it sit until it’s dry (has a kinda tacky feel to it) and then I put on a dime and a half (I have dry skin so I feel as if my skin needs more than just a dime lol) of the SUNDAY RILEY Tidal Cream! 

That’s it!! I repeat the same step at night as well! 

My skin type was dry/normal and now since using these products it’s mostly normal with a few dry patches appearing only when I haven’t exfoliated!

I exfoliate every 3 days using Skin Medica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser!!!

If you have any further questions let me know I’d love to answer them!!!

EDIT!!!
I use Kiehl’s Super Fluid Daily UV Defense Sunscreen with SPF 50 on my face in between the Advanced Night Repair serum and applying the Tidal cream!!! The sunscreen is a bit ashy but most are with my skin complexion. If you all have any other great suggestions for sunscreens I could use that would be awesome!

ttbud1,"This is almost certainly eczema. My non-allergic eczema started out like this (and then unfortunately spread everywhere else).

Another option is Eucrisa, though I found it much less effective. I also avoid putting anything else around my eyes except Vaseline. If I were you, I would stop applying any products around your eyes until you see a dermatologist in case your eczema is triggered by any of them. 

Unfortunately your eczema could be triggered by anything (food, dust, pollen, hygiene/skincare/household products, metal, fragrances, etc) — or nothing at all.

xyfyv9,"I’m required to wear makeup five days a week for 10-11 hours a day and it really takes a toll on my eyelids. They become so sensitive by the time I remove my makeup at the end of the day that they burn. I’ve experimented with a lot of different well reputed makeup brands because I thought maybe I was allergic to something, but it happens with any eye makeup. It’s just that my eyelids are sensitive. 

After trying a couple of different popular inexpensive creams to repair my irritated eyelids like cerave, aquaphor, (which made NO difference or even worsened them), these $70 Estée Lauder creams where the only savior that healed my eyelids to be able to wear makeup again the next day. 

Unfortunately with longer hours at work, even these products are not cutting it anymore, as amazing as they are. 

Is there any eye cream or ointment out there that gave you *even better* results than these Estée Lauder eye repair products. 

#I’m at my wits end and I’m willing to spend as much as it possibly takes! I’m just desperate for something that works really well. 

I’ve come to realize that even if something is rich in consistency and works great to heal/repair/moisturize other damaged parts of your skin, it could actually have completely opposite effects on eyelids (I’m talking to you, aquaphor). You get what you pay for, and I’m willing to spend BIG on a product that works for my dry, irritated, burning eyelids.

xyfyv9,How do you remove your eye makeup?,None,Estée Lauder,SkincareAddiction,0.0,neutral
xyfyv9,"I cant recommend an alternative moisturizer but you might have some options to minimize irritation.

1)  zinc is anti inflammatory so I actually use the blue lizard sensitive face mineral sunscreen on parts of my face that are feeling irritated overnight and it helps a lot.  Since its mineral its less likely to sneak in your eye or agitate it and can heal while you sleep.  

2)  you might be able to reduce the make up irritating your eyes.  Maybe you can go way more intense on lipstick and big earrings to distract from a minimal eye.  Or maybe magnetic bold eyelashes to eliminate mascara and Hawaiian hands makes a tinted sunscreen stick which has zinc for inflammation and coconut oil for moisturizer.   I often use this as concealer.  I have a thing about taking off my mascara at the end of the day so I use all these things to avoid putting it on at all.

You also dont need to double cleanse in the morning, in fact if you are on the drier side I'd reccomend not using any cleanser in the am except water and if combo-oily use the wash alone in the am.

Clinique All About Eyes eye cream - not bad, perfectly moisturising and good for under makeup, but I've moved on to other eye creams.

MAC - I love their lipsticks. Faves include Mehr, Mocha, Twig, Russian Red. The Springsheen blush is a dupe for Nars' Orgasm. I have a lot of their eyeshadows too. My top two are Satin Taupe and Club.

Although to answer your question, apply serums before tretinoin. Thin products, then thick. EL is indeed thicker than TO, but it’s still a serum so it’s thinner and should be absorbed onto clean skin before you apply your gooey retinol. If you decide to keep using it with your tret routine, that is. (If I were you, I’d stick with your The Ordinary serum with tret, and use the Night Repair for non-tret nights and mornings.)

Skin type: Dry, sensitive, rosacea 


AM

**Paula’s Choice Optimal Results Hydrating Cleanser**: 4/5 My HG cleanser! I tried so many other cleansers that left my skin irritated after multiple uses, but this has been my go-to for years. Knocking off one star because theres usually some makeup residue after PM use so not sure how well it’s truly cleansing?

**Hero Cosmetics Superfuel Serum Stick**: 5/5 This is so hydrating and I love that I don’t have to get serum all over my hands. 

**Metronidazole Topical Cream**: 2/5 I finally went to a derm for my rosacea and she prescribed me this for the morning. It hasn’t made any difference in 2 months, but hoping my redness will improve after longer term use. 

**Vanicream Moisturizing Lotion**: 5/5 My HG moisturizer forever and always. I did try their thicker Moisturizing Cream and it broke me out, but I can lather tons of this on my face with no issues so I just do multiple layers in the colder months. 

**EltaMD UV Daily**: 4/5 I love this sunscreen! A lot of people prefer UV Clear but I’m sensitive to Niacinamide. This is a great alternative and wears well under makeup. Knocking one star because it occasionally burns my eyes. 


PM

**e.l.f. Cosmetics Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm**: 4/5 I’m really surprised I liked this so much because I’m usually sensitive to added fragrance. After trying two fragrance-free balms that broke me out, I have no idea why this is the one that worked for me. I only use it on the days I wear makeup. 

**Paula’s Choice Optimal Results Hydrating Cleanser**

**Paula’s Choice Advanced Replenishing Toner**: 4/5 Love this no frills toner! The hyaluronic acid really hydrates my skin. I like to use a toner to get excess makeup off. 

**Hero Cosmetics Pimple Correct Gel Pen**: 3/5 I only use this when I have a pimple and it usually clears it up pretty quick. This actually has Niacinamide in it which I typically can’t use, but since I use such small amount for spot treatment so it doesn’t cause issues. 

**Ivermectin Topical Cream**: 3/5 This was the other product my dermatologist prescribed for my rosacea (lol didn’t know Ivermectin came in topical form). In two months I have not seen much improvement in my redness, however this makes my skin really soft and glowy. It’s not working as intended but it’s working!

One, it turns out that the odd burning sensation that I mentioned is eczema! So, for the reviews that mention that, ignore what I said.

To me, it sounds like an atypical situation that probably has some other cause, so I'm not sure if the usual "" just re-hydrate your skin with a better moisturizer and a less drying cleanser"" will actually be able to fix your problem.

It sounds like you have abnormally oily skin, from your description, and that can be a symptom of several medical conditions, like PCOS, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes (according to some quick internet searching).

193mjy,"It could be anything: genetics, diet, lifestyle, wrong skincare products.

I obtained my mom's oily skin. You mentioned that your dad is also super oily so there you go.

I used to wash my face two times plus splash with water four to six times a day but an hour later, my glasses would just slide down my nose. Right now, my skin is balanced but still slightly oily. I eliminated refined carbs and dairy from my diet and cut down on sugar intake. I eat more healthy fat foods (fishes, chicken thighs, avocados, coconuts, olive oil). I drink more than 80oz water a day. I no longer use commercial skincare products. I only use [carrier oils](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/oils.html) to moisturize and [Aztec Secret](http://www.iherb.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay-1-lb-454-g/29363) clay mask with raw apple cider vinegar twice a week. They are what it helps me to reduce oiliness.

*""Oily skin just means you're dry and your skin is trying to rehydrate itself.""* Not always. If you think you have dehydrated skin, your skin texture should feel little rough (I don't know how to describe it but something like scaly and ""dry"" lines on the forehead or under the eyes) and a little bit tight feeling especially after cleansing. If your skin is super smooth and not prone to dryness then you do actually have oily skin.

Ok, sorry for rambling. It doesn't hurt to see a dermatologist. S/he might will write you a prescription for Retin-A or a series of chemical peels with salicylic acid. They do help but it is not permanent. Either that or (well, here it go: my favorite quote---) you have to work with your skin instead of fighting against your skin.

ic5wsh,"This isn’t an effort to “argue” with the post above as much as it is some ~food for thought~. I’ve seen a lot of company takedowns as of late quite similar to what’s happening with glossier. While I think the employees choosing to speak out are brave and attesting to much needed changes in retail/the service industry, I also worry these issues are being misframed, and causing progressives to cast their fury in the wrong direction.

The complaints glossier employees have detailed are disgusting and valid. They also acknowledge that most of their complaints are sadly a natural consequence of working a service role that involves face to face interface with customers. Glossier - and most retail brands - are absolutely at fault when they fail to intercept unpleasant or racist customer interactions, but I’m not sure I would call these issues “systemic racism” or even company-faulted microaggressions. Systemic racism speaks specifically to policies imparted by the company that directly and consistently harm POC employees, like disproportionately not promoting them, etc. With the exception of the managers who apparently received no recourse for using incorrect pronouns/confusing POC employees (gross), I’m not sure any of these complaints really fall under the category of systemic company racism/sexism/etc. In reality I think this speaks to a much broader problem that is pervasive in the service industry in the US especially, which is a vehement capitalist attitude toward “customer satisfaction” that will ALWAYS value customer experience over low-level employee welfare. This also typically extends beyond racism/sexism - in the food industry as a service worker I was constantly barraged with abuse from customers who would almost always receive free food as compensation for their “grievances”. It sucked. It’s a major problem. It exists in other countries as well, but in my experience living abroad, managers tend to push back a bit more. In the US? Never. The customer is always right. 

Glossier has positioned itself as an ethical brand, which is why it’s now come under such fire for failing to meet customer/employee standards that it realistically never could. Are they more inclusive than other brands? Absolutely. But does that render them inherently ethical in the sense that they’ll prioritize ~seemingly minor~ employee complaints over making money? Of course not! Glossier is a brand and a capitalist institution. I’m saying this as someone who’s used their products but isn’t a particularly huge fan (I wouldn’t go to them for skincare stuff tbh): can we genuinely argue that other skincare brands are doing better? Do we know ANYTHING about the employee practices of brands like La Mer or Sunday Riley or anyone else? Not really. Glossier’s self-positioning as a supposedly ethical brand has forced it to be more transparent than most. It’s worth casting blame where blame is due and demanding action - this is a good thing! And I commend glossier employees. But before you all burn your milky jelly cleanser and denounce the company I compel you to question whether you feel confident assuming another brand behaves better.

Thanks for getting in touch—my apologies for any concern. I can confirm that the Solution formula is still active, effective, and completely safe to use.

Here's my 2 cents:

**-Hx:**Recently changing careers and need to super simplify my make up routine and improve my skin care. In the past my skin would always get dewey a few hours after I put on make up and I liked it. Now my skin is starting to feel drier, make up looks duller, and I'm breaking out more. Trying to bring back the dewey goodness.

-Customer service is excellent.

**-Birthday Balm Dot Com:** Holy smokes I LOVE IT. I am a serious lover of vanilla lip balms; POGO My Party and Chapstick Cake Batter are also two I love. Birthday BDC smells fantastic, is not as thick/goopy as POGO and more emollient than the Chapstick brand. Also, the teeniest, tiniest bit covers my lips completely -- was sad the package was a bit small, but I can see now it's going to last. Put Melt OnTheGo over the top and it made it into a sheer version. Sweetness.
Also tried the cherry flavor. It gets a big meh from me. Still their nice balm and it did have a slight red tint (why I tried it), but I didn’t love the cherry smell as much as I do vanilla. It was more medicinal than candy-like for me.

**-MilkyJelly Cleanser:** Has a very nice feel to it, cleansed well. Very comparable to my CeraVe Moisturizing Cleanser in texture and cleansing ability, but MilkyJelly is slightly more drying. Also, it actually did work pretty well to remove my makeup, but I still like to use an oil for double cleanse--so I’ll save it for the 2nd cleanse.  This has since become my favorite cleanser.  It works so well, feels gentle, and the smell is what does me in -- I look forward to it every night.

**-Moisturizing Primer:** I had really high hopes for this as I'm looking for something dewier than my CeraVePM that won't cause a breakout. It's definitely more dewey than my CVPM and it leaves a glossy sheen, but I still felt like I needed to put a couple drops of maracuja oil on after putting on make up (Bareminerals Complexion Rescue hydrating tinted gel). IDK, my skin is a desert now. Overall, I like the dewey finish and will continue to use this.  It's somewhat similar to Embryolysse.

**-Cloud Paints:** Powder blushes were starting to look cakey on me -- so these are exactly what i was hoping they would be. Very, very easy to use. Totally doofus-proof. Smooth finish. No powdery, dryness that sits on top of my skin. Dusk and Beam together look like a nice little tan and fresh sun. Really love these. I also use Benetints, which I still really like, but cloud paints are even easier as I didn't get any darker spots from not moving fast enough.

**Haloscope:** In Quartz. I really like this. It has a really natural looking shine. Honestly, IMO it could be more moisturizing and dewey, but like I said I think my skin might be turning into the Sahara, so maybe that's just me. When people joked that Glossier is just vaseline in different colors, I was sittin' here like ""sweet, pls come thru for me."" It's somewhat more moisturizing and definitely less powdery than Watts Up in a stick (not the one with the clear center-i've never tried that one) and all my powders. Pretty similar to High Beam, but goes on a little easier/more subtle/natural. Probably would like to get the other colors. *Have since ordered the other colors and they’re really great. The look of these is just enough sparkle and natural, dewey shine for me. Topaz for when I feel I need little color/sun and moonstone for a low key night out.  I think Topaz is my favorite, it looks like a natural, glow-y tan. 

**-Mask Duo:** The Greens Mask is true to it’s word as a very gentle cleansing mask. I felt clean and refreshed and not tight and dry after. Followed it with the Moon Mask and it does make you feel like a day at the spa. It’s cool and refreshing. It’s like the equivalent of chugging a pedialyte when you’re parched...but for your face. Not goopy, oily, or greasy. My skin felt super soft. I’m sure there may be ones of equal or better quality out there... but I like these.

**-You fragrance:** got a sample of this and it’s quiet lovely. Warm and comforting, clean and yet somewhat familiar.  Have since got this a birthday gift to myself.  I love it and I get compliments when I wear it, but it seems to diminish pretty quickly on my skin (like 2-3hrs tops of wear time). :(",Glossier,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,0.9998,positive

I love glossier! I think their makeup products are amazing, but not so much for the skincare though. I own most of their product, so here's my summarized thought:

**Skin Care:**

1. **Milky Jelly Cleanser**: Its a very gentle cleanser. But mediocre, as in nothing special. its a pass.
2. **Priming Moisturizer**: Its sticky, good for base. I have dry skin and this work just fine, easily top 5.
3. **Priming Moisturizer-Rich**: Its a thicker sister of the original. this break me out and burn my face, wouldn't recommend.
4. **Balm Dot com**: My holy grail. If there is anything you want to buy from glossier, I'd say, pick this one! Its hydrating and shiny. Its like a toned down gloss. I can't pick my fav shade cause I loveee them. All of them has a really nice smell. Wouldn't recommend birthday suit if you don't like sweet smell. To keep in mind, this product is petroleum based= like vaseline, so it won't fix your dry/chapped lips after taking the product off.
5. **The Super Pack**: Its an easy pass. Super bounce is the only out of the 3 I'd recommend. It does hydrate and I can see the difference when using it. The other two, idk. It has a water consistency and I don't see difference. For Vitamin-C serum, would highly recommend Sunday Riley and Drunk elephant.
6. **Mask Duo**: I initially love this product. It does do the job. The mega greens is not drying but suck the guck out. Moon mask is like a faster version of Water sleeping mask. Its not the most hydrating though, wouldn't recommend for people with dry skin. Mega greens is really similar to Lush's cosmetic warrior. Wouldn't repurchase this Cause its nothing out of the ordinary.

**Makeup:**

1. **Lash Slick:** Holy Grail. I've repurchased 4 times after the initial launch. Thats how much I love it. It separates your lashes, doesn't clump or budge. It is long lasting too. I have a long straight lash and this hold curls. The formula is dryer. Wand is small, perfect to get to the roots. + bottom lashes too! Note: it lengthens, but not volumize.
2. **Generation G:** recently bought zip, Leo, cake, and like in the new formula. Formula is stiffer/harder to apply than the old ones. Packaging 10/10, doesn't break like the old one. And I love that the bullet is bigger.
3. **Lidstar:** Its a meh product for me. It works, but its not supper shiny/shimmery as I'd love it to be. Doesn't work well for layering. I feel like there are much more cheaper alternative that works better. Its a pass.
4. **Cloud Paint:** Its one of my top 5 from glossier. I own dusk, beam, storm, and puff. This is worth buying. I can't find a dupe for this. The texture is unique. gel like with a satin finish. It doesn't completely dried down to matte but it last on your cheeks for long. A little product goes a long the way, its pigmented.
5. **Haloscope:** Its my everyday highlight! its very natural-looking. Gives you the glow-from-within look. Glossy finish with a finely milled shimmers. It stays dewy on the skin all day.
6. **Boybrow:** It used to be my fav product but I stopped using it. My front brows are patchy and this doesn't work with people with little brows. It does put your eyebrows in place and makes it fuller. very low-maintenance. Tbh, its by far the best brow gels I've find/use. even better than gimme brow.
7. **Stretch Concealer:** One of my all time fav concealer. This doesn't crease and stays dewy. It covers but not too much that its cak3-y. It won't cover super dark spots or pimple. Does well for under-eye. Perfect for everyday use. I even use this as my ""foundation"" lol.
8. **Perfecting Skin Tint:** I don't like foundation so this is perfect. Very lightweight and dewy! Your face will look glowy. It will even out redness, but again won't cover.
9. **Lip Gloss:** Its the glossiest of the glosses. its a thicker gloss. It will get sticky if applied too much, but is really really pretty on top the generation g. The price is quiet expensive for tiny boring clear gloss, but ugh its sooo good that the price doesn't matter.
10. **Wowder-Powder:** Best powder in the market! I even like it better than Laura Mercier and that's a big claim lol. I find it more finely-milled. It fills through cracks and doesn't crease. Doesn't give flashback either. If you're not a fan of natural makeup but still want to try glossier, this one is for you.",Glossier,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,0.9994,positive

I've tried out a fair amount of glossier products so I thought I would share some of my favorites :)

1. Cloud Paint (5/5) // I was kind of hesitant to purchase these since I'm not really a cream product person, but I honestly love these so much. The formula is great and the packaging is cute but be careful not to squeeze too much out at once. My favorite is puff but beam also looked great on my skin (light-medium, golden undertones).
2. Boy Brow (3.5/5) // I do like boy brow more than other brow gel, but I have quite stubborn and coarse brow hairs and they don't seem to be held in place by this product. I know most people looove this but it didn't work super well for me.
3. Balm Dot Com (4/5) // This is honestly one of my favorite lip balms of all time. It's super nourishing and moisturizing and smells great too (I have it in cherry). One thing I don't really like about it is the packaging: it's not the most convenient to use and some of the product can get stuck on the edges of the tube since there's not like an ""actual"" applicator
4. Lash Slick (4/5) // This is hands down one of the best looking mascaras I have ever tried. It is incredibly natural but makes your lashes look like 10 times better!!!!! It's pretty easy to wash off (just use warm water and the fibers should naturally come off). I do wish it held a curl better on my stubborn asian lashes though.
5. Priming Moisturizer (4.5/5) // I don't think this gets enough hype because it's honestly such a beautiful product. I don't really use it as a moisturizer but I really love how it applies under makeup. Some of the ingredients are a little questionable but I haven't noticed any reaction.
6. Milky Jelly Cleanser (3.5/5) // I think it's a great basic, everyday cleanser if that's what your looking for. I just think you can find cleansers that do similar things (ie. cerave) for a lesser price.",Glossier,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,0.9985,positive

**Boy Brow** is of course great and easy, I've repurchased.

I mix about 7 drops of the **Skin Tint** with my sunscreen every day – it works well that way and gives a nice glow. I've also repurchased this.

**Cloud Paints** are generally lovely and extremely pigmented! But Haze has a more watery consistency that comes off streaky when applied with fingers. Not great on my pale skin.

**Stretch Concealer** is good for redness and is moisturizing, but creases on my undereyes like crazy. I still use it sometimes to avoid the papery/dry finish of my other concealer. 

**Haloscope** (in quartz) is pretty but thick/oily on the skin. Just need to blend well to get rid of the shiny outline.

I love the **Gen G** lipsticks I have, in Leo and Crush. Easy to get a barely-there tint or bright pop of color. I'll probably buy more shades in the future.

The only thing I hated was **Lidstar** which I got in lily. It just looks like glitter unless I really build it up, then it's patchy. The texture is also sort of oily which makes it slide all over the place.",Glossier,Glossier,SkincareAddiction,0.9698,positive

uwhi4i,"My skin type is combination with occasional breakouts if I neglect skincare for more than a week. Got into skincare wanting to preserve my (24F) youngish complexion and reduce stress breakouts (glass skin is also a plus). So far, Sulwhasoo is always reliable for me and has shown the most noticeable effects- even on first use. Even when I ignore skincare for a week or so because of med school stress, one night’s routine is enough to get my complexion glowing again, so suffice to say I’m really a huge fanatic for this brand. 

I know a lot of people find the Sulwhasoo lineup overwhelming, but what I can attest is that it’s done WONDERS for my skin. Honestly I got into Sulwhasoo because it was dubbed as “THE luxury Korean skincare brand”, but it really does work as advertised for me!! Of course there are some that stand out more than the others. So, ask me anything about the products or how to use them. If you want reviews on other products I didnt expound on, please tell me too and I’d be happy to share! 


Additional information: My full daily routine is composed of these Sulwhasoo products (in order) (I’ve repurchased everything also) 

- Gentle Cleansing Foam
- Purifying Herbal Clay Purifying Mask (every other day) 
- First Care Activating Serum
- Essential/Essential Comfort Water and Emulsion
- Ginseng Water and Emulsion
- Ginseng Serum
- Firming cream
- Moisturizing cream
- Ginseng eye cream
- Ginseng Moisturizing cream
- Overnight Vitalizing mask
- Snowise cushion
- Loose powder
- Essential and Ginseng sheet masks

In addition to these Sulwhasoo products, sometimes I insert the Estee Lauder eye serum and Elizabeth Arden Retinol to my routine as needed. 

Special mentions/Short review of the best products:
- First Care Activating Serum
If you’re thinking of buying only one Sulwhasoo product, GET THIS ONE. I cannot emphasize how big of an impact this lone product has on my whole routine. It was the first Sulwhasoo product I’ve bought and applying it before everything in my routine really showed increase effects of everything I apply on my face - moisturizers make my skin softer than usual, serums brighten more etc. LoTs of people are spooked because it contains alcohol, but I’ve personally never felt the negatives of it. Applies watery and dries fast, giving you only a short wait time before you can apply the rest of your routine after. HOLY GRAIL product imho. 

Essential Water and Emulsion:
This alone can make for 1/2 of a whole routine if you’re pressed for time. In the mornings where I have to rush, I can ignore every other step in my routine except for these two, and my skin will still stay dewy and fresh even in the afternoon. Water is like a toner which is nice, and the emulsion applies thin, but still gives a nice soft moisturizing feel. Plus, if you follow the way the website teaches you how to apply it, the whole experience feels like a spa and really helps relax the nerves. 

Ginseng serum: 
Although this was hailed as one of the best products in the brand, I don’t really see that much effect on my skin? I was told that it was because it was meant for older skin, but nonetheless I do see effects in minimizing fine lines and giving an overall nutritive feel. Probably not advisable for those who aren’t used to Asian/herbal products though, since it has a very strong ginseng smell. Personally, I find the smell cathartic because it smells like old-timey skincare products my mother used to have, but to each their own. 

Purifying Herbal Clay Mask: THIS. SAVES. MY. SKIN. when I neglect skincare for a few days and everything feels rough and bumpy, I apply this and leave it on for 2-5 minutes. It makes my skin feel clean and refreshed. Easily one of the products that I run out of the most. It may be a clay mask, but I don’t think its comparable to other similar masks because it doesn’t really dry out my skin as much, and gives a very purifying feel to it too.

v6dfcg,"I can’t speak to Sulwhasoo specifically, but I mostly use luxury products and have used everything from The Ordinary to all the asian beauty to La Mer, so I think my insight may be helpful. 

You can get great products at a very affordable price point, but often where those products lack is in “cosmetic elegance,” which is whether a product has a nice texture/consistency/smell/etc, and also in packaging, since a lot of pricier products come in really good quality packaging that feels and looks fancy whereas cheaper products’ packaging can feel/look underwhelming. Personally, spending more to get more cosmetically elegant products with fancier packaging is worth it. Tons of other people think it isn’t. Both are valid! 

To answer your question… Well, that depends on a lot of factors and it’s very individual. 

Short answer: 

Maybe. You’d need to try it to know if it’s worth it for YOU because what’s worth it for you and someone else will not be the same. The only person who can decide if it’s worth it is you!

Long answer: 

My perspective is that skincare is my “happy place.” I love it, it brings me joy, using fancy products makes me excited for my routine, and I’m lucky to be in a good spot financially where spending a lot on skincare doesn’t cause me harm (however, I did prioritize spending on skincare even before I was doing super well financially because it made me feel good). To me, spending 100$+ on a HA/hydrating serum is worth it even if I can get something very similar for 10$ because it makes me happy and motivates me to do my routine, and I find it far more pleasant to use. I have ADHD so I need to get dopamine from something in order to be able to do it with ease, and making my skincare routine luxurious/exciting is one of those ways and therefore I stay consistent with it. Would I say that serum is worth it to me? 100% yes. Would I say it’s worth it for someone else? Not necessarily, and not at all if that person is on a tight budget. 

So, something being worth it really just boils down to whether it’s worth it for *you* based on *your individual needs and desires.* 

Skincare is also incredibly subjective! What works miracles for me could break you out like crazy and vice versa, so even my HGs that I believe are 100% worth the money may be totally not worth it for you. IMO, this is where most people hardcore f*ck up with skincare… It’s really important to remember how individual skin is and to never expect any product to perform miracles, regardless of the price tag. A product can only do so much whether it’s 10$ or 1000$. 

*My experience* with luxury skincare has been that it is more effective than more affordable products. I have seen more progress in my skin with a very expensive routine than I did when doing a similar routine with very inexpensive products. However, it could be the opposite for someone else. I’d apply that same logic to Sulwhasoo products: May be absolutely worth it or absolutely not worth it to others, but you’re not them and only you can decide what is and isn’t worth it for you.",Sulwhasoo,Sulwhasoo,SkincareAddiction,0.9988,positive
v6dfcg,"Like most luxury products, you’re paying for the experience and formulation. It’s worth if skincare as  an experience makes you happy and you have the means to do so.

TOP 3 game changers for me:

1. Sulwhasoo First Care Activating Serum - this is a LUXURY product... very expensive. I bought a 20 pack sampler from eBay because I wanted to see if the hype was worth it. It’s probably one of the better known products of this brand. And honestly it’s been two week since I’ve started using it and I feel like it’s what gives me a glow because it helps my face retain more moisture. I was complaining about dull skin before but this has made a noticeable difference. You are supposed to use it after you wash your face and before all other products. It claims to help “activate” the rest of your routine. I honestly will most likely purchase the full size after I finish all the packets. I started using the Sulwhasoo Timetreasure serum as part of breaking into anti-aging. This may also be what is contributing to the glow. I can’t say for sure though since I started both at the same time. However I think the first care serum does more because I use it day and night and can see the same effects during the day. 
2. Cosrx AHA 7 Whitehead Power Liquid - this stuff works WONDERS for me when I feel a breakout coming. I put it on the problem area (red bump appearing or those sore spots when you know a pimple is coming up) and it clears overnight. I feel like it also helps clear out existing breakouts faster too.  I don’t use it everyday as I found it was not effective for me. But usually 2-3 times a week at night. Beware it does smell like fish lol but I’ll take it. This is my second bottle. Honorable mention to the TO AHA/BHA mask that I use once a week. It has a similar effect. 
3. TO Azelaic acid - I feel like this has kept a lot of acne at bay. It also has really reduced the perpetual redness in my cheeks. My husband uses this as well and he used to have deep acne scars on his cheeks; they have since faded noticeably. He also uses this on current acne problem areas and feels like they have been clearing faster. 
4. Also honorable mention to Cosrx honey overnight mask. It has a gel texture which surprised me at first. Boy, it makes my dry cheeks not flakey and my skin is so smooth in the morning. It’s been a long time since I did not have flakes and I don’t wake up with an overly oily face either. I’ve only been using it for a week or so but it helps noticeably over just using TO moisturizer at night.

As someone who have tried tons of AB and EU sunscreens, comparing the Etude House Sunprise Mild Airy with ^((a mere)) *PA+++* finish with any high PPD European SPF is like asking for unicorn sunscreen.

You can try *Garnier Ambre Solaire Sensitive UV Face Fluid*, no fragrance, PPD 46, has alcohol, no white cast. It's the most bearable EU sunscreen but it's **not** dry touch like the Etude House Sunprise. 

Other brands that are popular, *Eucerin Oil Control Sun Gel* \- many oily skin folks love it. Has alcohol, no fragrance.

Neither are dry touch on my oily skin, but they are 'bearable'.

tsrree,"Product names are really a mouthful these days. Anyhoo, I have normal to dry skin.

**The essence:** It's moisturizing but not too thick. Absorbs nicely. I don't much care for the smell. The best thing about this essence is that it makes my skin softer than anything else (except maybe the Clinique Moisture Surge 100 hr...). I have used it for 3-4 months now.  The essence comes in a nice bottle with a pump.  Might repurchase.

isthsq,"Came in a multicolored speckled gray box and the product has a similar top to box with a slighly transparent pink outer and and white inside that contains the clear jelly “cream”. Has a light fragrance of cherry blossoms but smells similar to baby oil/powder. Layered on my face well with my other non-jelly products. I didn’t see a dewy glow in the day, because I always did a routine with SPF, but at night I see the glow. As it is a jelly it absorbs well into the skin. Didn’t leave a film or heavy feeling on my face. The moisture lasted me around 4hrs without a “dried-out” feeling but after the 4hrs my face was a comfortable “dry”. Due to the jelly absorbing so well, I am now open to trying other jelly/gel products. Would I buy again? Yes but it only last a month if you use both day and night as its only 1.69fl oz/50mL. I didn’t break out from the fragrance or the formula so its an okay product. 
+ I’m pretty clumsy and dropped this product once with the top unscrewed all the way and not a lot spilled out. Exp date wasn’t until next year and I bought it 3 months ago but used all of it in August.

isthsq,"I tried this when it was first released, its nice to see it get some love now! I usually stay away from fragranced things but this didn't irritate my skin.

I wish it kept that dewy finish like when you first apply it. heads up that the scent is strong at first, but pleasant. It does die down after about 5-10mins though. nice product but I wish it did something more specific if it doesnt moisturise as much as expected, like brightening the skin :)

If you like this try the im from vitamin tree gel moisturiser. Its what I use now and I really like it. Its doing a good job of brightening my skin.

**Journey:**

I came across this subreddit over a year ago. My main concern was my closed comedones on my forehead that have been there for as long as I can remember. I know it probably doesn’t look too bad but it’s always annoyed me. I’d been using argan oil as a moisturiser so I tried the oil cleansing method, but no luck. I then tried OCM with mineral oil as I realised I was allergic to certain oils like safflower and hemp seed oil, but no luck there either. Around this time I settled for the Aveeno Daily Moisturising Lotion which I’ve been using since, and kept a simple routine until I started chemical exfoliation this summer.



**Journey with BHA and AHA’s:**

Aug 15: Started using Stridex Maximum Strength Pads every other night. Increased to every night a week later, but got new spots the next day, so went back to every other night. I hardly got any new random spots on my face since using Stridex which is why I kept using it, but it did nothing for my CC’s.

Aug 28: Started using Nip+Fab Glycolic Fix Extreme Night Pads every other night. Didn’t notice any difference to skin.

Sep 20: Stopped using Nip+Fab. Only Stridex now.

Sep 27: Started using COSRX AHA every other night. New spots appeared so I cut back to every 4 days.

Oct 27: Went back to using COSRX AHA every other night.

Nov 21: Stopped using Stridex. Only COSRX AHA now.

Dec 21: Realised my CC’s had significantly reduced/gone. It was a very gradual process, I just remember looking into the mirror last week and thinking, wait, didn’t I used to have lots of small spots on my forehead? 

(Edit: After the popularity of this post, I had another look through my selfies and my CC's appear to have started reducing mid-November. I was preoccupied with things that I hadn't noticed until recently. That means it still worked whilst I was using Stridex too, and cutting Stridex out made no difference to my progress.)



**(First picture taken July 31st, second picture taken December 29th)**



I am now slowly introducing COSRX BHA Blackhead Power Liquid as my only concern now is my visible pores/SF’s. 



COSRX is my new favourite brand. I use their acne patches whenever I get the odd spot on my face and it works great. I’ve also recently bought the Low pH Good Morning Gel Cleanser.

sp690g,"25/F 

Skin type - Dry, sensitive, dehydrated (on Tretinoin 0.4% Microspheres) with PIE and PIH

Climate : Cold, polluted air. Very hard water

Months of usage : 4-5 consistently

Time of usage : AM/PM

Products used along with : Basic pharmacy moisturiser and sunscreen (spf 50)

🍁 It is a very viscous essence. I have not tried other essences but it feels a little thicker than it should be.
Having said that, a little product goes a long way. I use 2 pumps and its enough.

🍁On my dry skin, I apply it after washing my face and while my face is still damp. I follow it up with moisturiser and sunscreen

🍁 It hydrates. And when i say Hydrate, I mean the kind of hydration which comes from gulping a full bottle of water after a long day out in the sun.

🍁 The plumping effect it gives is unmatched. My skin enjoys the dewy glow. I also feel it has increased skin elasticity over time but that might just be an exaggeration because of my love for this product. 

🍁 Final review - I LOVE THIS. Cosrx as a brand needs no introduction. This product is one of their bestsellers and they have a very firm hold over the AB skincare market. The product does as advertised by the brand and I think I will be repurchasing it.",COSRX,COSRX,SkincareAddiction,0.9531,positive

span9g,"About me / my skin:

23F, mild to moderate acne since age 12. Skin has gotten drier and more sensitive as I've gotten older but the acne has persisted! I have been really happy with the rest of my routine and have been using the rest of the products for multiple years. My acne seems to be hormonal and using this routine has usually kept it to a manageable stable level.

Routine: AM/PM

* Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cleanser
   * Love this cleanser; have been using it for years
   * Really gentle, removes makeup, and has a nice gel texture to it that isn't drying
* Cosrx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid
   * My review is further down
* Cetaphil Moisturizing lotion
   * Super gentle and fairly moisturizing. This has never made my skin burn or sting like other thin moisturizers can.
   * Wears well under makeup
   * Less silicony-feeling than Cerave in the tub, which I used before switching to this
* Neutrogena Stubborn Acne Daily Leave On Mask
   * This product has helped my skin so much! It seems more gentle than other benzoyl peroxide products I have tried, while still being extremely effective for me. I find that it reduces inflammation and prevents breakouts from getting worse.
   * I put a thin layer over any problem areas at night. In the morning, I use it sparingly as a spot treatment if I'm not spending time outside. Putting a layer of this on under my mask also reduces the amount of maskne I get.
   * The texture is similar to a gel/cream. Can pill under makeup but I find that it's ok if I only apply a very thin layer.

Review:

Okay, now onto the review! In July/August 2021 my skin started getting very angry. It started breaking out nonstop while also getting drier by the day. My face became covered in closed comedones that never came to a head and just kept accumulating. I was travelling at the time and thought that once I got home and back into a regular routine, it would just need some time to recover.

After 6 weeks at home, my skin was still getting worse so I decided to try cutting out actives and focusing on moisturizing. By October, there was still no improvement and my skin looked like it does in the first photos above. The photos do not do the texture justice. My skin felt like sandpaper and it seemed like literally every pore on my face was clogged and hard or inflamed.

I started applying the Cosrx liquid once a day (PM) for the first week, then increased to twice a day when I was sure my skin could tolerate it. The texture of the product is really pleasant to me; it's very smooth and not too watery. I apply one pump using just my fingers. I did not find it to be drying at all which was one of my concerns considering how dry my face felt.

My face purged for about 3 weeks but I decided to stick with it and it slowly started to improve after that. By mid-January it had improved to what you see in the photo above and has stayed that clear since. This is the clearest my skin has ever been!

I was shocked that one product could make such a difference and felt like I had to share. I had read reviews on the Cosrx Power Liquid and the Paula's Choice BHA and a few people had said that the Cosrx was too gentle to make a difference. I chose to try it anyway because I was worried the PC BHA would be too harsh given the condition my skin was in. I wanted to share my experience to show that the Cosrx was strong enough of a BHA to work for someone.

1k2huw7,"I'd go with Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid first. Perfect for oily skin and those stubborn bumps (likely closed comedones). It's stronger than the COSRX toner but gentler than The Ordinary's glycolic.

Start with BHA 2-3 times weekly, then add Snail Mucin for hydration without heaviness. The COSRX toner is too mild for your issues and The Ordinary's glycolic might be too harsh as a starting point.",COSRX,COSRX,SkincareAddiction,0.0387,neutral
1k2huw7,"Just to be clear, you understand that salicylic acid and BHA are the same thing, right? So, there are very few scenarios where using BOTH at salicylic acid (i.e. BHA) cleanser AND a salicylic acid containing serum or toner at the same time makes sense. 95% of the time that will be too much salicylic and will irritate and over-dry the skin. Just pick the product you want to use with salicylic acid and stick with it... two products with salicylic can be problematic. The leave-on formulas (toners and serums) will be more effective because they stay on the skin instead of getting washed off. In that case, just pick a good, fragrance-free, non-medicated cleanser and use a Salicylic Acid toner or serum.

Can you share your age (or age range)? \~That would affect my recommendations, especially regarding The Ordinary Glycolic Acid and the Cosrx AHA/BHA because both contain glycolic acid, which is better suited for older skin (ages 30+ maybe, depending on skin type). Especially the TO Glycolic, I'd only probably recommend that one for ages 40+.

If either congested pores or oily skin are your main issues, and you're under age 30-ish, then Salicylic Acid will be most helpful. If you want to also add a different style of exfoliant, go with PHAs or some more gentle AHAs like Mandelica Acid or maybe some lower strength Lactic Acid (4% or less).

Also, would you describe your skin as sensitive or not?

The only product on your list I would avoid is the snail mucin. That one is a known allergen and carries the risk of irritation. There are other skincare ingredients that will out-perform snail mucin and don't have allergens.",COSRX,COSRX,SkincareAddiction,0.9369,positive

I started Lymecycline and took a 6 month course which got rid of the bumps and spots but did nothing for the redness which I believe is rosacea. About 6 months ago I started a consistent routine skincare routine and upped my water intake to at least 3 litres a day.

1jtorfw,"I have been using rice products recently and the milky goo that rice produces feels similar to snail mucin but actually more moisturizing. (I have and use both the COSRX Snail Mucin and multiple rice products). I would really suggest adding a Hyaluronic acid to your routine though, it will really help keep you moisturized and keep your skin plump and help with the dryness caused by Tret. 

I use Hada Labo Gokyujun Premium and really love it, but there’s also Torriden Dive In, ISNTREE Ultra-low Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Serum, mixsoon Glacier Water Hyaluronic Acid Serum and more. 

The rice I would suggest to you would be 9 Wishes Rice Water masks, there’s so much serum in it that I can do a mask, save the serum in the pack in a ziplock and then use it the next day as a serum or essence step. The masks come in packs of ten but if you do the leftover serum trick you can get 20 days out of the pack. They make my skin feel so moisturized and soft. I also have seen these at TJ max and Marshall’s for $9.99. They have licorice and ferments as well to help brighten and lighten spots or melasma. 

If you don’t want a mask then you could try Beauty of Joseon Glow Deep Serum Rice + Alpha Arbutin. 
It doesn’t have that sticky mucin consistency but it’s a really nice, gentle, hydrating and brightening serum. Usually $10 online and also at TJMaxx. The alpha arbutin will help with melasma as well.",COSRX,COSRX,SkincareAddiction,0.9955,positive
