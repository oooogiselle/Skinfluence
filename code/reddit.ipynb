OH MY GOD IM SO EXCITED YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL üòç', 'For my grad makeup I‚Äôm wearing a light coverage foundation just to cover the scars, but the difference in texture of my skin in both pics is so so astounding!! I started accutane January 2nd, 2018, and just finished it on June 4th. Still got those dry lips though. \\\\n\\\\nFor my routine I‚Äôve kept it pretty simple:\\\\n \\\\nAM\\\\nCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\\\\nCetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF\\\\n\\\\nPM\\\\nCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser\\\\nThayers Lavender Witch Hazel\\\\nCetaphil Daily Facial Mosturizer with SPF\\\\n\\\\nEdit : Wow I just want to thank everyone for their really kind words. I really appreciate all the support and the positivity being spread around, it‚Äôs such an amazing feeling to be happy with your own skin again!! \\\\n\\\\nI‚Äôve been having problems with acne for about 5 years now, and for anyone asking or worrying about accutane, I personally wish I‚Äôd started it sooner. Of course, I‚Äôm not an expert and you should definitely talk with a dermatologist about the drug, but in my case it was really worth it! To just be able to go to the grocery store without any makeup on and not worry about people looking at you is a feeling I haven‚Äôt had in a while. \\\\n\\\\nI‚Äôm extremely thankful that I was able to feel so confident in my dress, standing with my beautiful friends as we went to our graduation banquet last night. It was an amazing experience, and I‚Äôm just happy that high school is coming to an end! \\\\n\\\\nSo again, thank you to everyone for the congratulations, I‚Äôm glad to have shared some of my experience with anyone else going through the same thing right now. ', 'Ho....ly.....crap. You look glowing. Not just your skin which is incredible, but your smile too. Congrats on the wonderful progress! ', 'You look beautiful! Congrats! ', 'The expression on your face says it all.  Glad that this treatment regimen worked for you.  Beautiful.']\""
