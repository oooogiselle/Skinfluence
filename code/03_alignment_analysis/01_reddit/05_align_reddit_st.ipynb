As well as healing, soothing or strengthening the skin barrier. \\nI like Korean skincare because it usually offers a multiple targeting of skin issues. This hyaluronic acid serum reminds me a western skincare. \\nI would rather pick something like iUNIK Beta glucan serum.

The peptides are not going to do anything for if you're above 30 and have mature skin. These are basic peptides to start of you're at your 20s.....this feels nice on the skin I'm a oily skin person and it felt really good on the skin but just like any other hydrating toners or moisturizer....why buy this instead of a moisturizer ? There's only one copper peptide which is the copper tripeptide . Very weak ingredients....with the price of it you can buy a copper peptide serum , a multipeptide or argline serum and a retinol.....which will work way better for your skin than this in the long term. The amount of peptides are stupidly low for the price .   \n",

I use it with their Low PH Good Morning Cleanser, AHA/BHA Clarifying Treatment Toner and oil free ultra-moisturising lotion along with TO Niacinamide + zinc, buffet and 5% caffeine in both the AM and PM. I add TO granactive retanoid emulsion 2% in the PM and Pyunkang Yul black tea time reverse eye cream in the PM and I have the most clear, bright skin in years.\\n\\nAging + oily/combination skin makes for one hell of a routine!   \n",

Especially with Korean skincare, you have hyaluronic acid nearly everytime included in the product, plus you can also choose a product that has other hydrating ingredients. As well as healing, soothing or strengthening the skin barrier. \\nI like Korean skincare because it usually offers a multiple targeting of skin issues. This hyaluronic acid serum reminds me a western skincare. \\nI would rather pick something like iUNIK Beta glucan serum. Which has also calming benefits, is an antioxidant, repair skin barrier function and apparently it's ability to retain moisture is 20% better than hyaluronic acid. This serum has about 90% of all beta glucan.   \n",

       "931   I’ve been using the customary, well known COSRX Low PH Good Morning Gel Cleanser for 5 months now and its safe to say, this gel cleanser is a staple in my skincare routine.⁣⁣\\n⁣⁣\\nHaving dehydrated skin is tough given there’s many times your skin feels like the scales on a fish. This 150ml #lowphgelcleanser complements my hydration deprived skin, as advertised; maintaining the PH balance of skin whilst keeping skin soft, moist and refreshed without stripping natural and necessary oils ⁣⁣\\n⁣⁣\\nI love that this gel cleanser is light weight, transparent, has low foaming and fragrance free. I’m a sucker for fragrance free items. If you wouldn’t put perfume on your skin, why use fragranced products on your skin? ⁣⁣\\n\\nAll in all, I understand why this gel cleanser is a staple amongst many skin care enthusiasts from South Korea to the US. It’s affordable, it delivers as advertised and is globally accessible. I’m currently on half the bottle which is impressive given I’ve had this #cleanser for 5 months.

       "      <td>Product name: Glossier Futuredew\\n\\nPrice: $30 CAD/$24 USD for 30 mL\\n\\nWarning: long review ahead!\\n\\nWhen I was deciding whether to buy this, I didn’t find many reviews, so now that I’ve been using it for a while, I thought I’d post a review in case anyone else was interested. I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks. \\n\\nGlossier describes this product as an “oil serum hybrid” - it contains Jojoba, Grape Seed, Evening Primrose, and Rosehip Oils, as well as Squalane and Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract (fruit extract known to visibly increase brightness). It also contains mica to help give it that glowy, reflective finish. \\n\\nGlossier suggests applying this as the last step in your skincare routine (after sunscreen), which initially had me a bit confused, since usually sunscreen would be the last step in my skincare routine. But what I’ve now realized is that this product is not just skincare - it’s more like a skincare/makeup combo (and in my opinion, leans more towards makeup than skincare - more on that later). \\n\\nThis product dispenses as a peach-coloured serum with a slight pearly sheen. When applied to my face, it’s not oily or greasy like some face oils, but it definitely has a slight wet/sticky feeling on the face, which does fade slightly after a few minutes as the product absorbs. \\n\\nAs for the look - it does do an amazing job of giving me a glowy, dewy, “just-did-a-sheet-mask” look. The recommended two pumps is a bit too shiny for me, so I use one pump and I’m good. I have normal/dry skin. I did feel like it made some of my hyperpigmentation and scars look more prominent, but I was able to counteract that with a bit of concealer, which actually applied quite nicely over top of the Futuredew. Although it contains mica, I really don’t notice a shimmery/glittery appearance at all, it really just looks like a natural glow. \\n\\nIn terms of the skincare benefits, it has a slight moisturizing effect, but nothing major that I’m not already getting from my routine. I don’t think I’ve seen any significant change to my skin over the 6 weeks I’ve been using it, other than the short-term glow. So I think the product description of “oil serum hybrid” is a bit misleading. I would describe it more as an “face oil-highlighter hybrid”. \\n\\nSo overall, does it deliver? As an “oil-serum hybrid”, not quite. But as a “shortcut to the way your skin looks after a full skincare routine—dewy, glowing, cared-for” (another description from the Glossier website) - yes, it delivers. I think this is more of an issue with inconsistency in the way Glossier marketed this product than in the product itself. I think the product is good at what it does, which is giving that dewy look and making it last throughout the day. But don’t expect any significant lasting benefits. \\n\\nSo will I continue to use this product? I will use up the bottle I have, but probably not repurchase. I just don’t see this product as a necessary part of my routine. If I want glowy skin, I’m more likely to reach for a classic highlighter like Glossier’s haloscope, and if I want a moisturizing oil, I’m more likely to reach for TO’s Rosehip oil. I’m just not reaching for Futuredew as much as I’d like to. \\n\\nOverall rating: 3.5/5 WNRP</td>\n",

I'm 46, Caucasian and live in the southern United States. I’m not sure if I’m using all the products in exactly the right order, but this is my routine:\\n\\nMorning:\\n1. Gentle cleansing foam\\n2.

The peptides are not going to do anything for if you're above 30 and have mature skin. These are basic peptides to start of you're at your 20s.....this feels nice on the skin I'm a oily skin person and it felt really good on the skin but just like any other hydrating toners or moisturizer....why buy this instead of a moisturizer ? There's only one copper peptide which is the copper tripeptide . Very weak ingredients....with the price of it you can buy a copper peptide serum , a multipeptide or argline serum and a retinol.....which will work way better for your skin than this in the long term. The amount of peptides are stupidly low for the price .   \n",
       "382   Product name: Glossier Futuredew\\n\\nPrice: $30 CAD/$24 USD for 30 mL\\n\\nWarning: long review ahead!\\n\\nWhen I was deciding whether to buy this, I didn’t find many reviews, so now that I’ve been using it for a while, I thought I’d post a review in case anyone else was interested. I’ve been using this product for about 6 weeks. \\n\\nGlossier describes this product as an “oil serum hybrid” - it contains Jojoba, Grape Seed, Evening Primrose, and Rosehip Oils, as well as Squalane and Evodia Rutaecarpa Extract (fruit extract known to visibly increase brightness). It also contains mica to help give it that glowy, reflective finish. \\n\\nGlossier suggests applying this as the last step in your skincare routine (after sunscreen), which initially had me a bit confused, since usually sunscreen would be the last step in my skincare routine. But what I’ve now realized is that this product is not just skincare - it’s more like a skincare/makeup combo (and in my opinion, leans more towards makeup than skincare - more on that later). \\n\\nThis product dispenses as a peach-coloured serum with a slight pearly sheen. When applied to my face, it’s not oily or greasy like some face oils, but it definitely has a slight wet/sticky feeling on the face, which does fade slightly after a few minutes as the product absorbs. \\n\\nAs for the look - it does do an amazing job of giving me a glowy, dewy, “just-did-a-sheet-mask” look. The recommended two pumps is a bit too shiny for me, so I use one pump and I’m good. I have normal/dry skin. I did feel like it made some of my hyperpigmentation and scars look more prominent, but I was able to counteract that with a bit of concealer, which actually applied quite nicely over top of the Futuredew. Although it contains mica, I really don’t notice a shimmery/glittery appearance at all, it really just looks like a natural glow. \\n\\nIn terms of the skincare benefits, it has a slight moisturizing effect, but nothing major that I’m not already getting from my routine. I don’t think I’ve seen any significant change to my skin over the 6 weeks I’ve been using it, other than the short-term glow. So I think the product description of “oil serum hybrid” is a bit misleading. I would describe it more as an “face oil-highlighter hybrid”. \\n\\nSo overall, does it deliver? As an “oil-serum hybrid”, not quite. But as a “shortcut to the way your skin looks after a full skincare routine—dewy, glowing, cared-for” (another description from the Glossier website) - yes, it delivers. I think this is more of an issue with inconsistency in the way Glossier marketed this product than in the product itself. I think the product is good at what it does, which is giving that dewy look and making it last throughout the day. But don’t expect any significant lasting benefits. \\n\\nSo will I continue to use this product? I will use up the bottle I have, but probably not repurchase. I just don’t see this product as a necessary part of my routine. If I want glowy skin, I’m more likely to reach for a classic highlighter like Glossier’s haloscope, and if I want a moisturizing oil, I’m more likely to reach for TO’s Rosehip oil. I’m just not reaching for Futuredew as much as I’d like to. \\n\\nOverall rating: 3.5/5 WNRP   \n",

I do feel it leaves a sticky layer but it also is quite hydrating and makes me look insanely dewy. I have built an HA-free routine and can vouch it is great for dry skin!   \n",

       "382   Before we launched Glossier in 2014, we started as Into The Gloss. A beauty website and community devoted to sharing real information with real people, about really amazing products. It’s where we realized that beauty shouldn’t be built in a boardroom—it should be built by you. This ethos gave birth to our philosophy: Skin First. Makeup Second™. We prioritize skincare because we believe that healthy skin is the best foundation. We believe in thoughtful design and cultivating conversations. It’s at the core of everything we do—the starting point of all our makeup, skincare, bodycare, and fragrance products. At Glossier, beauty is about celebrating freedom of expression, individuality , and having fun. Our Skin First. Makeup Second™ approach ensures that every product supports your skin’s health, allowing your makeup to enhance rather than mask your natural beauty.   \n",

I absolutely love that stuff and use it every day. I put on two layers while spritzing thermal water in between to get it to really soak in. It is so hydrating and plays well with all of my other products. It also lasts forever.   \n",
       "3855  Hey I’ll try keeping this short - \\n\\nIf you mention you have extreme dryness around the eyes pls avoid using eye creams esp those with a high concentration of, say, retinol. It’ll dry it out further. \\nYou need to start by balancing the moisture in that region as well. Don’t ask me how, I’m no expert in this unfortunately. You’ll have to do some research or technically stop using the thing that may be drying out that region. \\n\\nFor dark circles, puffiness, etc (if you’re unable to stick to a sleep schedule, good diet and all) you can use any decent, well priced eye cream to reduce the _appearance_ of these. There is nothing in the market that gets rid of them, anything that claims to do so is false. \\n\\nYou don’t need to spend the amount given on this laneige product, you can go with any other trustworthy Indian brand like minimalist as well.   \n",

The only thing that helped me was Lanolips 12 hour lip mask\\nyou can also try the lip glowy balm by laneige. I think that has better hydration.   \n",

The water content should mean it’s hydrating as well. \\n\\nWhen I was repairing my skin barrier I paired it with SOS Barrier Repair cream and it was incredible. \\n\\nMaybe give it a few days. You might also want to let it dry done just a slight bit more. If it’s the silicone TO moisturizer it might be mixing weirdly, or is it possible that your skin isn’t a fan of your current moisturizer?   \n",

       "1683  So here's my two cents. Mucin does appear to have healing benefits, but for skin to be healthy, it needs to retain moisture first and foremost. I found this product far too drying. The Hyaluronic acid sucked my skin dry. However, using this as a... Serum step... And then layering an occlusive moisturizer on top might be the way to go. Perhaps this product will work better underneath something more substantial   \n",
