There's only one copper peptide which is the copper tripeptide . Very weak ingredients....with the price of it you can buy a copper peptide serum , a multipeptide or argline serum and a retinol.....which will work way better for your skin than this in the long term.

These are basic peptides to start of you're at your 20s.....this feels nice on the skin I'm a oily skin person and it felt really good on the skin but just like any other hydrating toners or moisturizer....why buy this instead of a moisturizer ? There's only one copper peptide which is the copper tripeptide . Very weak ingredients....with the price of it you can buy a copper peptide serum , a multipeptide or argline serum and a retinol.....which will work way better for your skin than this in the long term. The amount of peptides are stupidly low for the price .   \n",

The Armani has a nice glow but unless you plan to touch up with powder every few hours it might not give the desired effect.\\n\\nPair the foundation with a really good skincare routine starting a few weeks out to give it time to take effect. Focus on hydration so that the matte foundation can still have a softness to it.   \n",

       "1683  So here's my two cents. Mucin does appear to have healing benefits, but for skin to be healthy, it needs to retain moisture first and foremost. I found this product far too drying. The Hyaluronic acid sucked my skin dry. However, using this as a... Serum step... And then layering an occlusive moisturizer on top might be the way to go. Perhaps this product will work better underneath something more substantial   \n",
